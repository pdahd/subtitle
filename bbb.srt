00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,580
- Last summer when I was doing my internship

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,810
in Mongolia, I got a call from two classmates

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,073
in Tanzania.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,583
They had a very urgent question.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,093
How to use their washing machine

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,000
because all the labels were in Chinese

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,380
and Google kept translating a big button

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,684
as spinning ghost mode.

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,190
There we were, an Indian and the Thai calling me,

10
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,900
a Chinese, in Mongolia

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,480
to decipher a washer in Tanzania.

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,405
And we all studied together here at Harvard.

13
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,630
- The moment reminds me of something I used to believe

14
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,640
when I was a kid

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,543
that the world was becoming a small village.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,660
I remember being told we will be the first generation

17
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,893
to end hunger and poverty for humankind.

18
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,880
My program at Harvard is International Development.

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,713
- Whoo! - Yeah!

20
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,680
- It was built on this exact beautiful vision

21
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,273
that humanity rises and falls as one.

22
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,580
When I met my 77 classmates

23
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,103
from 32 different countries,

24
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,100
the countries I knew only as colorful shapes on a map

25
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,880
turned into real people with laughter, dreams,

26
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,910
and the perseverance to survive the long winter.

27
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,909
In Cambridge.

28
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,900
- We danced through each other's traditions

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,823
and carried the weight of each other's walls.

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Global challenges suddenly felt personal.

31
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,570
If there's a woman anywhere in the world

32
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,110
who cannot afford a period pad,

33
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,076
it makes me poor.

34
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,440
If a girl who skip school out of fear

35
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,193
of harassment, that threatens my dignity.

36
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:24,422
If a little boy dies in a war

37
00:03:27,953 --> 00:03:29,855
that he didn't start

38
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:31,605
and never understood,

39
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:37,105
part of me dies with him.

40
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:54,831
But today, that promise of a connected world,

41
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,070
it's giving way to division,

42
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,593
fear and conflict.

43
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,360
We're starting to believe

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,230
those who think differently, vote differently,

45
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,850
will pray differently whether they are across the ocean,

46
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,203
or sitting right next to us, are not just wrong.

47
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,376
We mistakenly see them as evil.

48
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,883
But it doesn't have to be this way.

49
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,500
What I've gained most from Harvard isn't just calculus

50
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,393
or regression analysis,

51
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,030
is to sit - Whoo!

52
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,653
- with discomfort,

53
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,333
listen deeply,

54
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,420
and stay soft

55
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,853
in hard times.

56
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,680
Because if we still believe in a shared future,

57
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,300
let us not forget those who were labeled as enemies.

58
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,153
They too are human.

59
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,490
In seeing their humanity,

60
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,998
we find our own.

61
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:25,470
In the end,

62
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,580
we do not rise by proving each other wrong.

63
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,310
We rise by refusing

64
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,394
to let one another go.

65
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,200
So, class of 2025, when the world feels stuck

66
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,911
in spinning ghost mode,

67
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,730
just remember as we leave this campus,

68
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,730
we carry everyone we've met across wealth and poverty,

69
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,640
cities and villages, faith and doubt.

70
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,300
They speak different languages and dream different dreams,

71
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,300
and yet they've all become part of us.

72
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,103
You may disagree with them,

73
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,850
but hold on to them as we are bound

74
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,093
by something deeper than belief.

75
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,581
Our shared humanity.

76
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,270
Congratulations, class of 2025.
