1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,580
- Last summer when I
was doing my internship

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,810
in Mongolia, I got a
call from two classmates

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,073
in Tanzania.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,583
They had a very urgent question.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,093
How to use their washing machine

6
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:23,160
(audience laughing)

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,000
because all the labels were in Chinese

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,380
and Google kept translating a big button

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,684
as spinning ghost mode.

10
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:37,684
(audience laughing)

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,190
There we were, an Indian
and the Thai calling me,

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,900
a Chinese, in Mongolia

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,480
to decipher a washer in Tanzania.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,230
(audience laughing)

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,405
And we all studied
together here at Harvard.

16
00:00:59,405 --> 00:01:00,257
(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

17
00:01:00,257 --> 00:01:02,246
- Yeah!
(audience cheering)

18
00:01:02,246 --> 00:01:07,246
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,630
- The moment reminds me of
something I used to believe

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,640
when I was a kid

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,543
that the world was
becoming a small village.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,660
I remember being told we
will be the first generation

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,893
to end hunger and poverty for humankind.

24
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,880
My program at Harvard is
International Development.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,713
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

26
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:43,713
(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

27
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,680
- It was built on this
exact beautiful vision

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,273
that humanity rises and falls as one.

29
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,580
When I met my 77 classmates

30
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,103
from 32 different countries,

31
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:08,103
(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

32
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,100
the countries I knew only
as colorful shapes on a map

33
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,880
turned into real people
with laughter, dreams,

34
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,910
and the perseverance to
survive the long winter.

35
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,909
In Cambridge.

36
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:25,742
(audience laughing)
- Whoo!

37
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,900
- We danced through
each other's traditions

38
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,823
and carried the weight
of each other's walls.

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Global challenges suddenly felt personal.

40
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:45,665
(birds chirping)

41
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,570
If there's a woman anywhere in the world

42
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,110
who cannot afford a period pad,

43
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,076
it makes me poor.

44
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,820
(birds chirping)

45
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,440
If a girl who skip school out of fear

46
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,193
of harassment, that threatens my dignity.

47
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:11,456
(birds chirping)

48
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:13,303
(person cheering)
(audience cheering)

49
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:14,946
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

50
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:18,113
(audience applauding)

51
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:24,422
If a little boy dies in a war

52
00:03:27,953 --> 00:03:29,855
that he didn't start

53
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:31,605
and never understood,

54
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:37,105
part of me dies with him.

55
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:43,925
(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

56
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:54,831
But today, that promise
of a connected world,

57
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,070
it's giving way to division,

58
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,593
fear and conflict.

59
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,360
We're starting to believe

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,230
those who think differently,
vote differently,

61
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,850
will pray differently whether
they are across the ocean,

62
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,203
or sitting right next to
us, are not just wrong.

63
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,376
We mistakenly see them as evil.

64
00:04:24,376 --> 00:04:27,390
(birds chirping)

65
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,883
But it doesn't have to be this way.

66
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,500
What I've gained most from
Harvard isn't just calculus

67
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,393
or regression analysis,

68
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,030
is to sit
- Whoo!

69
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,653
- with discomfort,

70
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,333
listen deeply,

71
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,420
and stay soft

72
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,853
in hard times.

73
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,680
Because if we still
believe in a shared future,

74
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,300
let us not forget those who
were labeled as enemies.

75
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,153
They too are human.

76
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,490
In seeing their humanity,

77
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,998
we find our own.

78
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:16,998
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

79
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:25,470
In the end,

80
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,580
we do not rise by
proving each other wrong.

81
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,310
We rise by refusing

82
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,394
to let one another go.

83
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:37,044
(birds chirping)

84
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:38,569
(audience applauding)

85
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:43,200
(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

86
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,200
So, class of 2025, when
the world feels stuck

87
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,911
in spinning ghost mode,

88
00:05:50,911 --> 00:05:52,410
(audience chuckling)

89
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,730
just remember as we leave this campus,

90
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,730
we carry everyone we've met
across wealth and poverty,

91
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,640
cities and villages, faith and doubt.

92
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,300
They speak different languages
and dream different dreams,

93
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,300
and yet they've all become part of us.

94
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,103
You may disagree with them,

95
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,850
but hold on to them as we are bound

96
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,093
by something deeper than belief.

97
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,581
Our shared humanity.

98
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:37,530
(birds chirping)

99
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,270
Congratulations, class of 2025.

100
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,270
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)
