waiting on companies like apple

you know Black Monday type of day

marginally red so  
小幅收跌的一天  

23  
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,240  
I don't think that it's the markets

necessarily freaking out

over what's going on with these announcements

26  
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,080  
but I do think broadly speaking

27  
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,120  
there was this concern that uh  
存在一种担忧...  

28  
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,600  
you know look  
你知道的  

29  
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,360  
we had gotten over most of the crazy tear of headlines  
我们刚熬过密集的新闻轰炸期  

30  
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,840  
about a month ago and after the 90 day pause

31  
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,280  
and especially the escalation

32  
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,560  
especially with China uh  
尤其是与中国的关系  

33  
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,440  
there was maybe some thought within Wall Street

34  
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,080  
that maybe this is going to be a quieter summer  
今年夏天会比较平静  

35

00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,320  
kicking back up some of these tariff headlines  
又重提关税议题  

39  
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,040  
I do think that has the volatility

40  
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,920  
perhaps coming back marginally  
波动性小幅回升  

41  
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,200  
to Wall Street but again  
但问题还是在于  

42  
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,960  
the question here is what he's saying on true social  
他在Truth Social上的发言  

43  
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,520  
be to be taken literally or figuratively  
该按字面理解还是象征性解读  

44  
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,160  
that is kind of  
这其实是  

45  
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160  
the ongoing story with this administration  
这届政府的一贯作风  

46  
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,000  
and that's something that Wall Streets

47  
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000  
gonna have to grap with

48  
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,800  
as we continue to see these tariff threats  
随着关税威胁持续  

49  
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,680  
going forward right  
对吧  

50  
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,360  
and then another confusing call by the president uh  
总统另一个令人困惑的呼吁

or face it tariff

53  
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,160  
is what he's calling for actually realistic

what exactly is he threatening here

55

well originally in the morning  
今天早上他最初  

56  
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,200  
when he posted on Truth Social

57

suggesting that he was not only looking at

specifically Terrafing Apple

61  
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,800  
there were a lot of questions swirling around over

how could the president do that

but to take one specific company

67  
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,280  
then one specific product remained legally ambiguous

68  
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,480  
although

quote he didn't want to be unfair to apple

the specific target of his true social

75  
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,660

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,880  
expand the scope of this particular tariff  
扩大这项关税的范围  

77

Samsung a Korean phone that makes a lot of

Android based products so  
安卓设备的公司  

83  
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,880  
it does sound like

if he does wanna follow through on this 25% tariff

完全在美国生产的  

90  
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,600  
yeah of course the

91  
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,160  
the key there will he follow through  
他是否会落实  

92

because he's threatened a lot of terrorists

93  
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,840  
and not necessarily

94  
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,040  
many of them actually manifest themselves

you know president was actually  
坚持要求
