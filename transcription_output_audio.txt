1
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
This town ain't seen nothing yet.

2
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,440
Wow, cool video.

3
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,920
Looks like the team has been having some fun.

4
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,360
Hello, everyone.

5
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,080
Good morning.

6
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,680
Welcome to Google IO.

7
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,000
So good to see everyone here in Shoreline.

8
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,080
And hello to everyone joining virtually around the world.

9
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,680
I learned that today is the start of Gemini season.

10
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,840
Not really sure what the big deal is.

11
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,040
Every day is Gemini season here at Google.

12
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,840
Normally, you wouldn't have heard much from us in the weeks leading up to I.O.

13
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,480
That's because we'd be saving our best models for this stage.

14
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:20,560
But in our Gemini era, we are just as likely to ship our most intelligent model on a random Tuesday in March or a really cool breakthrough like Alpha Evolve just a week before.

15
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,640
We want to get our best models into your hands and our products ASAP.

16
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,400
And so we are shipping faster than ever.

17
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:40,160
We have announced over a dozen models and research breakthroughs and released over 20 major AI products and features all since the last IO.

18
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,800
I'm particularly excited about the rapid model progress.

19
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,600
You can see the step function change here.

20
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,360
ELO scores, one measure of progress, are up more than 300 points since the first generation of Gemini Pro.

21
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,880
And today, Gemini 2.5 Pro sweeps the LM Arena leaderboard in all categories.

22
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,480
It is state-of-the-art on many, many benchmarks.

23
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,680
And we have also made rapid progress in coding.

24
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,040
Our updated 2.5 Pro reached number one on WebDev Arena and now surpasses the previous version by 142 ELO points.

25
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,000
It's getting a lot of love across the top coding platforms, thanks to all of you.

26
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:42,320
On Cursor, the leading AI code editor, Gemini is the fastest growing model of the year, producing hundreds of thousands of lines of accepted code every single minute.

27
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,920
Now this last milestone might be the most impressive, at least in some circles.

28
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,320
A couple of weeks ago, Gemini completed Pokemon Blue.

29
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:09,600
It earned all eight badges, traveled the victory road, defeated the Elite Four, and the champion, bringing us one step closer to achieving API, artificial Pokemon intelligence.

30
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:21,120
All of this progress is enabled by our world-leading infrastructure, the foundation of our full-stack approach to AI.

31
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,640
Our seventh-generation TPU, Ironwood, is the first design to power thinking and inference at scale.

32
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:38,160
It delivers 10x the performance over the previous generation and packs an incredible 42.5 exaflops of compute per pod.

33
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
Just amazing.

34
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,200
And it's coming to Google Cloud customers later this year.

35
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,920
Our infrastructure strength down to the TPU is what helps us deliver dramatically faster models.

36
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:06,960
Of the top models on the Ella Marina leaderboard, Gemini holds the top three spots for highest output tokens generated per second, all while model prices are coming down significantly.

37
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,480
There's a hard trade-off between price and performance.

38
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,640
Yet over and over, we've been able to deliver the best models at the most effective price point.

39
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,960
Not only is Google leading this parade of frontier, we've fundamentally shifted the frontier itself.

40
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,480
The result, more intelligence available for everyone, everywhere.

41
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,360
And the world is responding and adopting AI faster than ever before.

42
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,000
It's one marker of progress.

43
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:44,800
This time last year, we were processing 9.7 trillion tokens a month across our products and APIs.

44
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,280
Now, we are processing 480 trillion monthly tokens.

45
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,360
That's about a 50x increase in just a year.

46
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,280
We're also seeing a wave of adoption across our developer AI tools.

47
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:11,120
Today, over 7 million developers have built with the Gemini API across both Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.

48
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,760
Over 5x growth since last I.O.

49
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,160
And Gemini usage on Vertex AI is up more than 40 times since last year.

50
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280
AI adoption is increasing across our products.

51
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,920
The Gemini app now has over 400 million monthly active users.

52
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,440
We are seeing strong growth and engagement, particularly with 2.5 models.

53
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,120
For those using 2.5 Pro in the Gemini app, usage has gone up 45%.

54
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,520
You will hear a lot more about the Gemini app later.

55
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,560
We're also seeing incredible momentum in search.

56
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,720
Today, AI overviews have more than 1.5 billion users every month.

57
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:00,560
That means Google search is bringing generative AI to more people than any other product in the world.

58
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,320
And along with AI overviews, AI mode is the next big step for search.

59
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,200
You'll hear more about this later.

60
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:21,680
What all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are becoming reality for people all over the world.

61
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I want to share three examples of how research is transforming our products today, Project Starline, Astra, and Mariner.

62
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,200
We debuted Project Starline, our breakthrough 3D video technology at I.O.

63
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,400
a few years back.

64
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,480
The goal was to create a feeling of being in the same room as someone, even if you were far apart.

65
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:57,040
We've continued to make technical advances, and today we are ready to announce our next chapter, introducing Google Beam, a new AI-first video communications platform.

66
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:06,800
Beam uses a new state-of-the-art video model to transform 2D video streams into a realistic 3D experience.

67
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,560
Behind the scenes, an array of six cameras captures you from different angles.

68
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:26,960
And with AI, we can merge these video streams together and render you on a 3D light field display with near-perfect head tracking down to the millimeter and at 60 frames per second, all in real time.

69
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,520
The result, a much more natural and deeply immersive conversational experience.

70
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,800
We are so excited to bring this technology to others.

71
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:45,200
In collaboration with HP, the first Google Beam devices will be available for early customers later this year.

72
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,720
HP will have a lot more to share a few weeks from now.

73
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,400
Stay tuned.

74
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:07,760
Over the years, we've been bringing underlying technology from Starline into Google Meet that includes real-time speech translation to help break down language barriers.

75
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:15,840
Here's an example of how this could be useful when booking a vacation rental in South America and you don't speak the language.

76
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,120
Let's take a look.

77
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,320
Hi, Camilla.

78
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,480
Let me turn on speech translation.

79
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,800
It's nice to finally talk to you.

80
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,360
Es bueno, hablarte finalmende.

81
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,440
No podes perad al quilar tu casa.

82
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,560
Tibasa yu er tir mucho quero que te te vanca.

83
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,080
You're gonna have a lot of fun, and I think you're gonna love visiting the city.

84
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,160
The house is in a very nice neighborhood and overlooks the mountains.

85
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,000
That sounds wonderful.

86
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,080
Is the house una maravilloso?

87
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,480
Es la casa cercana en transporte pÃºblico o recomiendas al quilar uncoche.

88
00:10:51,040 --> 00:11:00,240
Ayuna togo cerca, but there's a bus nearby, but I would recommend renting a car so you can visit the nature and enjoy it.

89
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,840
That sounds great.

90
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,920
Eso suenas jenyal.

91
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,160
You can see how well it matches the speaker's tone, patterns, and even their expressions.

92
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,480
We are even closer to having a natural and free-flowing conversation across languages.

93
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,000
And today, we are introducing this real-time speech translation directly in Google Meet.

94
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:39,200
English and Spanish translation is now available for subscribers with more languages rolling out in the next few weeks.

95
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,760
And real-time translation will be coming to enterprises later this year.

96
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,280
Another early research project that debuted on the I.O.

97
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,880
stage was Project Astra.

98
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,240
It explores the future capabilities of a universal AI assistant that can understand the world around you.

99
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,640
We are starting to bring it to our products.

100
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:12,720
Today, Gemini Live has Project Astra's camera and screen sharing capabilities so you can talk about anything you see.

101
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,520
People are using it in so many ways, whether practicing for a job interview or training for a marathon.

102
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:26,240
We've been appreciating the feedback from our trusted testers and some who are a little less trusted.

103
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,440
Take a look.

104
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,400
That's a pretty nice convertible.

105
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,000
I think you might have mistaken the garbage truck for a convertible.

106
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,840
Is there anything else I can help you with?

107
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,320
What's this skinny building doing in my neighborhood?

108
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,200
It's a streetlight, not a building.

109
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,360
Why are these palm trees so short?

110
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,800
I'm worried about them.

111
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,080
They're not short.

112
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
They're actually pretty tall.

113
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,000
Sick convertible.

114
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,760
Garbage truck again.

115
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,360
Anything else?

116
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,640
Why do people keep delivering packages to my lawn?

117
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,760
It's not a package, it's a utility box.

118
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,360
Why is this person following me wherever I walk?

119
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,880
No one's following you.

120
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,040
That's just your shadow.

121
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,400
Gemini is pretty good at telling you when you're wrong.

122
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,640
We are rolling this out to everyone on Android and iOS starting today.

123
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,000
Next, we also have our research prototype, Project Mariner.

124
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,640
It's an agent that can interact with the web and get stuff done.

125
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:50,880
Stepping back, we think of agents as systems that combine the intelligence of advanced AI models with access to tools.

126
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,880
They can take actions on your behalf and under your control.

127
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,720
Computer use is an important agentic capability.

128
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,960
It's what enables agents to interact with and operate browsers and other software.

129
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,000
Project Mariner was an early step forward in testing computer use capabilities.

130
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,240
We released it as an early research prototype in December, and we have made a lot of progress since.

131
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,920
First, we are introducing multitasking, and it can now oversee up to 10 simultaneous tasks.

132
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,440
Second, it's using a feature called Teach and Repeat.

133
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,400
This is where you can show it a task once, and it learns a plan for similar tasks in the future.

134
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,360
We are bringing Project Mariner's computer use capabilities to developers via the Gemini API.

135
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:51,600
Trusted testers like Automation Anywhere and UiPath are already starting to build with it, and it will be available more broadly this summer.

136
00:14:51,920 --> 00:15:02,960
Computer use is part of a broader set of tools we will need to build for an agent ecosystem to flourish, like our open agent-to-agent protocol so that agents can talk to each other.

137
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:10,000
We launched this at CloudNext with the support of over 60 technology partners and hope to see that number grow.

138
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,880
Then there is the model context protocol introduced by Anthropic so agents can access other services.

139
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:24,000
And today we are excited to announce that our Gemini SDK is now compatible with MCP2s.

140
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,600
These technologies will work together to make agents even more useful.

141
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,920
And we are starting to bring agentic capabilities to Chrome, Search, and the Gemini app.

142
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,280
Let me show you what we are excited about in the Gemini app.

143
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
We call it agent mode.

144
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,760
Say you want to find an apartment for you and two roommates in Austin.

145
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,040
You've each got a budget of $1,200 a month.

146
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,040
You want a washer dryer or at least a laundromat nearby.

147
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,840
Normally, you'd have to spend a lot of time scrolling through endless listings.

148
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,640
Using agent mode, the Gemini app goes to work behind the scenes.

149
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:16,160
It finds listings from sites like Zillow that match your criteria and uses Project Mariner when needed to adjust very specific filters.

150
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:24,880
If there's an apartment you want to check out, Gemini uses MCP to access the listings and even schedule a tour on your behalf.

151
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:34,000
And it'll keep browsing for new listings for as long as you need, freeing you up to do the stuff you want to do, like plan the housewarming party.

152
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,000
It's great for companies like Zillow, bringing in new customers and improving conversion rates.

153
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,480
An experimental version of the agent mode in the Gemini app will be coming soon to subscribers.

154
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:57,040
This is a new and emerging area, and we are excited to explore how best to bring the benefits of agents to users and the ecosystem more broadly.

155
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,240
The best way we can bring research into reality is to make it really useful in your own reality.

156
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,320
That's where personalization will be really powerful.

157
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,520
We are working to bring this to life with something we call personal context.

158
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:24,000
With your permission, Gemini models can use relevant context across your Google Apps in a way that is private, transparent, and fully under your control.

159
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,480
Let me show you an example in Gmail.

160
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,480
You might be familiar with our AI-powered smart reply features.

161
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,560
It's amazing how popular they are.

162
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,560
Now imagine if those responses could sound like you.

163
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,880
That's the idea behind personalized smart replies.

164
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,240
Let's say my friend wrote to me looking for advice.

165
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,240
He's taking a road trip to Utah and he remembers, I did this trip before.

166
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,800
Now, if I'm being honest, I would probably reply something short and unhelpful.

167
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,400
Sorry, Felix.

168
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,720
But with personalized smart replies, I can be a better friend.

169
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,000
That's because Gemini can do almost all the work for me.

170
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:16,160
Looking up my notes in Drive, scanning past emails for reservations, and finding my itinerary in Google Docs, Trip to Zion National Park.

171
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:28,880
Gemini matches my typical greetings from past emails, captures my tone, style, and favorite word choices, and then it automatically generates a reply.

172
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:38,000
I love how it included details like keeping driving time under five hours per day, and it uses my favorite adjective, exciting.

173
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,920
Looks great.

174
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,840
Maybe you want to make a couple of changes to it and hit send.

175
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,800
This will be available in Gmail this summer for subscribers.

176
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:00,960
And you can imagine how helpful personal context will be across search, docs, Gemini, and more.

177
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,560
Today, I've talked about intelligence, agents, and personalization.

178
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,520
These are a few of the frontiers where we will make progress, and you will hear more examples throughout the keynote.

179
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,520
But first, I want to invite someone who can share more about the intelligence driving our future innovation.

180
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,720
Last year, I introduced him as Sir Demist.

181
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,360
This year, we can add Nobel laureate to his list of titles.

182
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,800
Come on out, Demist.

183
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,240
Hey, everyone.

184
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
It's really great to be back here at I.O.

185
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,480
We're living through a remarkable moment in history, where AI is making possible an amazing new future.

186
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,840
It's been a year of relentless progress for us.

187
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,480
As Sundar said, people love interacting with Gemini 2.5.

188
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,520
We've seen you vibe code with it, building games and apps in a single shot.

189
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,920
You've used its vast reasoning powers on everything from unpacking scientific papers to understanding YouTube videos.

190
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,840
And you've told us how collaborative, insightful, and genuinely helpful you found using Gemini.

191
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,880
It's so exciting for us to see the awesome things you've all been doing and building with it.

192
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,640
Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most intelligent model ever and the best foundation model in the world.

193
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,800
Just two weeks ago, we shipped a preview of an updated 2.5 Pro so you could get your hands on it and start building with it right away.

194
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:49,520
We've been really impressed by what you've created, from turning sketches into interactive apps to simulating entire 3D cities.

195
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,040
The new 2.5 Pro tops the popular coding leaderboard WebDev Arena.

196
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:04,320
And now that it incorporates LearnLM, our family of models built with educational experts, 2.5 Pro is also the leading model for learning.

197
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,720
And it's number one across all the leaderboards on LM Arena.

198
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,240
Gemini Flash is our most efficient workhorse model.

199
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,360
It's been incredibly popular with developers who love its speed and low cost.

200
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,040
Today, I'm thrilled to announce that we're releasing an updated version of 2.5 Flash.

201
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:33,440
The new Flash is better in nearly every dimension, improving across key benchmarks for reasoning, code, and long context.

202
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,360
In fact, it's second only to 2.5 Pro on the LM Arena leaderboard.

203
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm excited to say that Flash will be generally available in early June, with Pro soon after.

204
00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:01,680
We're making final adjustments based on your feedback, but you can go try out the preview now in AI Studio, Vertex AI, and Gemini App.

205
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,760
As always, we're looking to push the state-of-the-art relentlessly forward, and we're excited about our latest research advances.

206
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:16,960
To tell you more, I'd like to welcome Tulsi to the stage, but first, let's take a look at what you're building with Gemini today.

207
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,400
Can you make a bunch of like study circles explode out of my mouth?

208
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,880
I've updated the sketch.

209
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Okay, what should we build next?

210
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,440
Okay, here's another 30 ideas for you.

211
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,520
Thanks, Demis.

212
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:55,520
I'm so excited to share the improvements we're creating to make it easier for developers like all of you to build with Gemini 2.5, all based on your feedback with improved capabilities, enhanced security and transparency, better cost efficiency, and more control.

213
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:05,120
First, in addition to the new 2.5 flash that Demis mentioned, we are also introducing new previews for text-to-speech.

214
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:13,920
These now have a first-of-its-kind multi-speaker support for two voices built on native audio output.

215
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,920
This means the model can converse in more expressive ways.

216
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,440
It can capture the really subtle nuances of how we speak.

217
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,640
It can even seamlessly switch to a whisper like this.

218
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,640
This works in over 24 languages, and it can easily go between languages.

219
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:51,680
So the model can begin speaking in English, but then switch back, all with the same voice.

220
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,560
That's pretty awesome, right?

221
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,160
You can use this text-to-speech capability starting today in the Gemini API.

222
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,000
Yeah.

223
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:19,040
The live API will also have a 2.5 flash preview version of native audio dialogue later today.

224
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,640
So you can directly build conversational experiences with a more natural Gemini.

225
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,720
It's even able to distinguish between the speaker and background voices, so it knows when to respond.

226
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,080
And Logan and Paige will show you more in the developer keynote.

227
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,280
Second, we've strengthened protections against security threats like indirect prompt injections.

228
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,600
So Gemini 2.5 is our most secure model yet.

229
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:54,480
And in both 2.5 Pro and Flash, we're including thought summaries via the Gemini API and Vertex AI.

230
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:05,680
Thought summaries take the model's raw thoughts and organize them into a clear format with headers, key details, and information about model actions like tool calls.

231
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:16,160
This gives you increased transparency for what the model is thinking, which is especially useful for high latency tasks, while also just being easy to debug and consume.

232
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,920
You also asked us for more efficiency.

233
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:32,400
So today's 2.5 flash is even more efficient, reducing the number of tokens the model needs to use for the same performance, resulting in 22% efficiency gains on our emails.

234
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,600
Finally, we launched 2.5 Flash with thinking budgets to give you control over cost and latency versus quality.

235
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,760
And the response was great.

236
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:51,440
So we're bringing thinking budgets to 2.5 Pro, which will roll out in the coming weeks along with our generally available model.

237
00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:00,720
With thinking budgets, you can have more control over how many tokens the model uses to think before it responds, or you can simply turn it off.

238
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,160
Now, as you heard from Demis, Gemini 2.5 Pro is incredible at coding.

239
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,280
So now, let me show you how you can take any idea you have and bring it to life.

240
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,680
So if you've ever been to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, it has a set of amazing exhibits.

241
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:30,560
So to bring that to you today, I got 2.5 Pro to code me a simple web app in Google AI Studio to share some photos and learn more.

242
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,200
So here's what I have so far.

243
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,120
But I want to make it more interactive.

244
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,040
And I'm still brainstorming the design, but I've got some ideas.

245
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,160
You've seen something like this before, right?

246
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,720
Someone comes to you with a brilliant idea scratched on a napkin.

247
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,760
As a PM, I'm often with someone.

248
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,560
Now, standard two-dimensional web design is one thing.

249
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,960
But I wanted to make it 3D.

250
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,560
And I learned that jumping into 3D isn't easy.

251
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,760
It requires learning about all kinds of new things.

252
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,560
Setting up a scene, camera, lighting, and more.

253
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,720
Luckily for me, 2.5 Pro can help.

254
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:22,800
So here, what I'm going to do is I am going to add the image I just showed you of the sphere.

255
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,320
And I'm going to add in a prompt that asks 2.5 Pro to update my code based on the image.

256
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
So we'll let 2.5 Pro get to work.

257
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,400
And as you can see, it's starting to think, and it's going ahead and creating a plan based on what I asked for.

258
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,440
And it'll apply it to my existing code base.

259
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:54,160
Because Gemini is multimodal, it can understand the abstract sphere sketch and code beautiful 3D animations, applying them to my existing app.

260
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,560
So this takes about two minutes.

261
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,400
So for the purpose of time, we're going to do this baking show style.

262
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,440
And I'm going to jump to another tab that I ran right before this keynote with the same prompts.

263
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,480
And here's what Gemini generates.

264
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,080
Whoa.

265
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,520
We went from that rough sketch directly to code, updating multiple of my files.

266
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,560
And actually, you can see it thought for 37 seconds.

267
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,880
And you can see the changes it thought through and then the files it updated.

268
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:39,680
We did all of this in AI Studio, so once I finished prototyping, I can simply deploy the code along with my Gemini API key.

269
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,800
So here's our final app in Chrome.

270
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Look at these animations.

271
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:56,160
And I didn't need to have advanced knowledge of 3.js libraries or figure out the complex 3D math to build this.

272
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,920
I know it would have taken forever to do this by hand, and instead, I was able to create this just based on a sketch.

273
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,720
I can make this experience even richer with multimodality.

274
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,880
So I use 2.5 Flash to add a question to each photo, inviting you to learn a little more about it.

275
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,120
But what if it talked?

276
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,720
That's where Gemini's native audio comes in.

277
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,760
That's a pangolin, and its scales are made of keratin, just like your fingernails.

278
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,680
Wow.

279
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,280
Now we're talking.

280
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,680
You can hear how you can add expressive audio right into your apps.

281
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:45,440
And before I share more, I'll leave this demo with another fun layout that 2.5 Pro coded just for us.

282
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,760
We've put the starter code for anyone to build on top of this demo in Google AI Studio, so go try it out.

283
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:15,440
And this is just one example of how Gemini 2.5 is changing how we build and how you can leverage the incredible capabilities to integrate vision, speech, and coding into your own applications.

284
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:31,280
2.5 Pro is available on your favorite IDE platforms and in Google products like Android Studio, Firebase Studio, Gemini Code Assist, and our asynchronous coding agent, Jules.

285
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:44,240
Just submit a task, and Jules takes care of the rest, fixing bugs, making updates.

286
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,600
It integrates with GitHub and works on its own.

287
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:56,000
Jules can tackle complex tasks in large code bases that used to take hours, like updating an older version of Node.js.

288
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,800
It can plan the steps, modify files, and more in minutes.

289
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:08,560
So today, I'm delighted to announce that Jules is now in public beta, so anyone can sign up at jules.google.

290
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,120
And like Demis said, we're always innovating on new approaches to improve our models, including making them more efficient and performant.

291
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,200
We first revolutionized image and video generation by pioneering diffusion techniques.

292
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,560
A diffusion model learns to generate outputs by refining noise step by step.

293
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,920
Today, we're bringing the power of diffusion to text with our newest research model.

294
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,240
This helps it excel at tasks like editing, including in the context of math and code.

295
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:54,560
Because it doesn't just generate left to right, it can iterate on a solution very quickly and error correct during the generation process.

296
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:05,760
Gemini diffusion is a state-of-the-art experimental text diffusion model that leverages this parallel generation to achieve extremely low latency.

297
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:19,280
For example, the version of Gemini diffusion we're releasing today generates five times faster than even 2.0 flashlight, our fastest model so far, while matching its coding performance.

298
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,840
So take this math example.

299
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,800
Ready?

300
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,440
Go.

301
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,280
If you blinked, you missed it.

302
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,080
Now earlier, we sped things up.

303
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,960
But this time, we're going to slow it down a little bit.

304
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,600
Pretty cool to see the process of how the model gets to the answer of 39.

305
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,840
This model is currently testing with a small group.

306
00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:00,880
And we'll continue our work on different approaches, lowering latency in all of our Gemini models, with a faster 2.5 flashlight coming soon.

307
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,680
And now, for more on the future of Gemini, back to you, Demis.

308
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,280
Thanks, Tulsi.

309
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:21,040
We've been busy exploring the frontiers of thinking capabilities in Gemini 2.5.

310
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:27,920
As we know from our experience with AlphaGo, responses improve when we give these models more time to think.

311
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,840
Today, we're making 2.5 Pro even better by introducing a new mode we're calling DeepThink.

312
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,280
It pushes model performance to its limits, delivering groundbreaking results.

313
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:49,040
DeepThink uses our latest cutting-edge research in thinking and reasoning, including parallel techniques.

314
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,160
So far, we've seen incredible performance.

315
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,880
It gets an impressive score on USAMO 2025, currently one of the hardest maths benchmarks.

316
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,400
It leads on Live Code Bench, a difficult benchmark for competition-level coding.

317
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:13,760
And since Gemini has been natively multimodal from the start, it's no surprise that it also excels on the main benchmark measuring this, MMMU.

318
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:26,000
Because we're defining the frontier with 2.5 Pro Deepthink, we're taking a little bit of extra time to conduct more frontier safety evaluations and get further input from safety experts.

319
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:34,800
As part of that, we're going to make it available to trusted testers via the Gemini API to get their feedback before making it widely available.

320
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:40,240
You'll hear more about our plans for 2.5 Pro Deepthink from Josh later today.

321
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,360
Over the past decade, we've laid a lot of the foundations for the modern AI era.

322
00:35:48,000 --> 00:36:08,880
From our pioneering work inventing the Transformers architecture, which today underpins all large language models, to agent systems like AlphaGo and AlphaZero, we continue to double down on the breadth and depth of our fundamental research, to invent the next big breakthroughs that are needed for artificial general intelligence.

323
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:18,560
Gemini is already the best multimodal foundation model, but we're working hard to extend it to become what we call a world model.

324
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:26,720
That is a model that can make plans and imagine new experiences by simulating aspects of the world, just like the brain does.

325
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:35,920
This is something I've always been passionate about, having thought about virtual worlds since my early days, developing AI for simulation games like Theme Park.

326
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:54,320
We've been taking strides in this direction for a while, through our pioneering work training agents to master complex games like Go and StarCraft, to most recently, our Genie2 model, capable of generating 3D simulated environments that you can interact with just from a single image prompt.

327
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:03,200
You can already see these capabilities emerging in the way Gemini can use its world knowledge and reasoning to represent things in nature.

328
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:12,480
And in VO, our state-of-the-art video model, which has a deep understanding of intuitive physics, like how gravity, light, and materials behave.

329
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,800
It's really incredible how well VO maintains accuracy and consistency across frames.

330
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:25,680
It knows what to do, even when the prompts get a little creative, like this person made out of life rafts.

331
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,600
Understanding the physical environment will also be critical for robotics.

332
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,880
AI systems will need world models to operate effectively in the real world.

333
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:47,600
We fine-tuned a specialized model, Gemini Robotics, that teaches robots to do useful things like grasp, follow instructions, and adjust to novel tasks on the fly.

334
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,480
For those of you here today, you can play around with the robots in the AI sandbox.

335
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,960
Making Gemini a full world model is a critical step in unlocking a new kind of AI.

336
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:15,280
One that's helpful in your everyday life, that's intelligent and understands the context you're in, and that can plan and take action on your behalf across any device.

337
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:22,320
This is our ultimate vision for the Gemini app, to transform it into a universal AI assistant.

338
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,440
An AI that's personal, proactive, and powerful, and one of our key milestones on the road to AGI.

339
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:38,480
This starts with the capabilities we first explored last year in Project Astra, such as video understanding, screen sharing, and memory.

340
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,760
Over the past year, we've been integrating capabilities like these into Gemini Live for more people to experience today.

341
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,920
Of course, we continue to relentlessly improve and explore new innovations at the frontier.

342
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,640
For example, we've upgraded voice output to be more natural with native audio.

343
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,000
We've improved memory and added computer control.

344
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,600
Let's take a look.

345
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,680
I'm here with the latest research prototype of Project Astra, and we're going to see how it can help me fix my bike.

346
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,200
Hey, go online and look for a user's manual for a Huffy mountain bike.

347
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,000
I have found a user manual for you.

348
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,520
What would you like to know about it?

349
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,320
Okay, cool.

350
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,880
Now, scroll until you find the section about the brake.

351
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,080
Sure thing.

352
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,680
I'm looking for that page now.

353
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,760
I think I tripped it through.

354
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,800
Can you go on YouTube and find a video for how to pick that?

355
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,160
Of course.

356
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,920
I'm open to YouTube now.

357
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,120
Place a rubber band over the head of the screw on my bread.

358
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Go through my emails with the bike job and find which side text net it is.

359
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,040
Sure.

360
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,320
According to the email from Bicycle Habitat, you need a 3-8 inch textnet for your sprocket.

361
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,320
I've highlighted the correct one for you.

362
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,520
It seems like I need a spare attention screw.

363
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,400
Can you call the nearest bike job and see what they have in the talk?

364
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,200
Yep.

365
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,400
Calling them now.

366
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,320
I'll get back to you with what they have in the talk.

367
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,640
I think my brake pads are wearing down.

368
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,520
Can you check the menu again and see if it talks about them anywhere?

369
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,640
According to the menu, if you look on page 24.

370
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,000
Do you want to get back?

371
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,520
Yeah.

372
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,960
Give me five minutes.

373
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,120
Can you finish what you were saying?

374
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,400
That's what I was saying.

375
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,520
If you look on page 24, section 2, you'll see how to replace the brake pads.

376
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,600
Hey, any updates on that call?

377
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:28,560
Yep.

378
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,240
I just got off the bike shop.

379
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,560
We can certainly have your attention through in the doc.

380
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,480
Would you like me to place a pickup order?

381
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,240
Could you show me some examples of dog baskets I can put on my bike?

382
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:38,960
Sure.

383
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,000
I can help you with that.

384
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,680
Just give me a moment.

385
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,520
Here are some options.

386
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,920
I think Zooka would look really great in the end.

387
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,560
A universal AI assistant will perform everyday tasks for us.

388
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:09,200
It will take care of mundane admin and surface delightful new recommendations, making us more productive and enriching our lives.

389
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:23,600
We're gathering feedback about these new capabilities now from trusted testers and working to bring them to Gemini Live, new experiences in search and the live API for developers, as well as new form factors like Android, XR, glasses.

390
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,000
You'll hear more on this later today.

391
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:33,920
My entire career at its core has been about using AI to advance knowledge and accelerate scientific discovery.

392
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,160
At Google DeepMind, we've been applying AI across almost every branch of science for a long time.

393
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:47,680
In just the past year, we've made some huge breakthroughs in a wide range of areas, from mathematics to life sciences.

394
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,880
We've built AlphaProof that can solve mass olympiad problems at the silver medal level.

395
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,800
Co-scientists that can collaborate with researchers, helping them develop and test novel hypotheses.

396
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:05,920
And we've just released AlphaEvolve, which can discover new scientific knowledge and speed up AI training itself.

397
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,280
In the life sciences, we've built AMI, a research system that could help clinicians with medical diagnoses.

398
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:19,120
AlphaFold 3, which can predict the structure and interactions of all of life's molecules.

399
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:30,800
And Isomorphic Labs, which builds on our AlphaFold work to revolutionize the drug discovery process with AI, and will one day help to solve many global diseases.

400
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,800
In just a few short years, AlphaFold has already had a massive impact in the scientific community.

401
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:45,280
It's become a standard tool for biology and medical research, with over 2.5 million researchers worldwide using it in their critical work.

402
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:59,200
As we continue to make progress towards AGI, I've always believed, if done safely and responsibly, it has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery and be the most beneficial technology ever invented.

403
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Taking a step back, it's amazing to me that even just a few years ago, the frontier technology you're seeing today would have seemed nothing short of magic.

404
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:25,600
It's exciting to see these technologies powering new experiences in products like Search and Gemini, and also coming together to help people in their daily lives.

405
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:37,920
For example, we recently partnered with IRA, a company that assists people in the blind and low vision community, to navigate the world by connecting them via video to human visual interpreters.

406
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,240
Using Astra technology, we build a prototype to help more people have access to this type of assistance.

407
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,920
We're getting ongoing feedback from users while ARA's interpreters are actively supervising for safety and reliability.

408
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:14,320
With this and all our groundbreaking work, we're building AI that's more personal, proactive, and powerful, enriching our lives, advancing the pace of scientific progress, and ushering in a new golden age of discovery and wonder.

409
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:25,920
I remember as a child playing until it got dark outside to make sure I could still play guitar without being able to see.

410
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,000
I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa when I was probably about four years old.

411
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:45,680
My vision is actively deteriorating, but, you know, music has been something that I can continue to do with the closing in of my visual reality.

412
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,880
I feel free when I'm playing music.

413
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,760
If Project Astra can help me be more independent, it would be, you know, the greatest thing ever.

414
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:07,920
Touring, for example, I love it because I get to go out and go to places I've never been before and meet new people, but it definitely is becoming more difficult.

415
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,960
Hello there!

416
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:09,840
Hello!

417
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:15,840
Can you tell me what you see in this green room while I scan around?

418
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,800
I see a sign on the wall in the direction you're facing.

419
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:24,240
The sign says Wi-Fi Network, the Gray Eagle, and the password is live music.

420
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,440
Thank you very much.

421
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,160
Can you help me locate a microphone stand?

422
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,440
Sure, I can help with that.

423
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,440
Do you mind if I turn on the flashlight?

424
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,960
Yes, please.

425
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:40,320
I see a wall with several coiled cables, and what look like mic stands towards the top right of the video.

426
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,840
The most powerful thing I can do is to get on stage, pick up my guitar, and play.

427
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:54,640
It helps people understand that there's more than just blind or not blind, disability and ability.

428
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,200
If Project Astra could help me along the way, I'm all for it.

429
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,000
Have a great time at your show.

430
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,840
Thanks, Demis.

431
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,360
It's amazing to see the possibilities for Project Astra to help with accessibility.

432
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:28,560
It's another exciting example of how AI is advancing our timeless mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.

433
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,240
No product embodies our mission more than Google Search.

434
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:42,000
It's the reason we started investing in AI decades ago and how we can deliver its benefits at the scale of human curiosity.

435
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:48,960
Our Gemini models are helping to make Google Search more intelligent, agentic, and personalized.

436
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,040
One great example of progress is our AI overviews.

437
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,720
Since launching at I.O.

438
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:02,080
last year, they have scaled up to over 1.5 billion users every month in more than 200 countries and territories.

439
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,800
As people use AI overviews, we see they are happier with their results and they search more often.

440
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:18,400
In our biggest markets like the US and India, AI overviews are driving over 10% growth in the types of queries that show them.

441
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,760
What's particularly exciting is that this growth increases over time.

442
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,880
It's one of the most successful launches in search in the past decade.

443
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,360
AI overviews are also one of the strongest drivers of growth for visual searches in Google Lens.

444
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:49,360
Lens grew 65% year over year, with more than 100 billion visual searches already this year.

445
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,640
So people are asking more queries and they're also asking more complex queries.

446
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:05,200
With our latest Gemini models, our AI overviews are at the quality and accuracy you've come to expect from search and are the fastest in the industry.

447
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:12,240
For those who want an end-to-end AI search experience, we are introducing an all-new AI mode.

448
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,120
It's a total reimagining of search.

449
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:22,800
With more advanced reasoning, you can ask AI mode longer and more complex queries like this.

450
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:30,240
In fact, users have been asking much longer queries, two to three times the length of traditional searches.

451
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,840
And you can go further with follow-up questions.

452
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,640
All of this is available today as a new tab right in search.

453
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,200
I've been using it a lot, and it's completely changed how I use search.

454
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:49,200
And I'm excited to share that AI mode is coming to everyone in the US starting today.

455
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,760
AI mode is where we will first bring our frontier capabilities into search.

456
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:06,720
And starting this week, Gemini 2.5, our most intelligent model series, is coming to search.

457
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,080
To share a whole lot more, here's less.

458
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,200
Thanks, Sundar.

459
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,560
In just one year, there's been a profound shift in how people are using search.

460
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:33,680
For years, people have come to Google to ask questions like this.

461
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,400
And now, they're also asking questions that look more like this.

462
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:46,240
They're asking longer questions, harder ones, and as you just heard from Sundar, lots more of them.

463
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:58,240
They're experiencing what AI-powered search can do as we bring together our Gemini model's advanced capabilities with search's unparalleled understanding of the web and the world's information.

464
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:10,080
Today you'll see how you can ask anything, and a more intelligent, agentic, and personalized search will take on your toughest questions and help you get stuff done.

465
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:16,720
This is the future of Google search, a search that goes beyond information to intelligence.

466
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,600
And you're starting to see this come to life already with AI overviews.

467
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,080
And AI Mode takes this to the next level.

468
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,160
AI Mode is search transformed with Gemini 2.5 at its core.

469
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,200
It's our most powerful AI search, able to tackle any question.

470
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,360
And as Sunder announced, we're excited to start rolling out AI Mode for everyone in the U.S.

471
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,960
starting today.

472
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,840
You'll find it as a new tab directly in search or right from your search bar.

473
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,680
AI Mode will be loaded up with all of our best AI features and capabilities.

474
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,920
But it's even more than that.

475
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,320
It's a glimpse of what's to come.

476
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:12,560
Over time, we'll graduate many of AI Mode's cutting-edge features and capabilities directly into the core search experience.

477
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:19,680
That starts today as we bring the same models that power AI mode to power AI overviews.

478
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,920
So you can bring your hardest questions right to the search box.

479
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:38,960
Today we'll give you a tour of AI Mode, and you'll see how it works and how it's getting even better with personal context, deeper research, complex analysis and visualization, live multimodality, and new ways to shop.

480
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,400
Now that's a lot, because AI Mode can do a lot.

481
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,080
So let's dive in.

482
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,720
First, with AI Mode, you can ask whatever's on your mind.

483
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,840
And as you can see here, search gets to work.

484
00:51:52,400 --> 00:52:05,200
It generates your response, putting everything together for you, including links to content and creators you might not have otherwise discovered, and merchants and businesses with useful information like ratings.

485
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:16,240
Search uses AI to dynamically adapt the entire UI, the combination of text, images, links, even this map, just for your question.

486
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,120
And you can follow up conversationally.

487
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,560
Now AI mode isn't just giving you information.

488
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,160
It's bringing a whole new level of intelligence to search.

489
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,600
What makes this possible is something we call our query fan out technique.

490
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,640
Now under the hood, search recognizes when a question needs advanced reasoning.

491
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,920
It calls on our custom version of Gemini to break the question into different subtopics.

492
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,480
And it issues a multitude of queries simultaneously on your behalf.

493
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,160
It searches across the entire web, going way deeper than a traditional search.

494
00:52:52,720 --> 00:53:06,320
And it taps into all of our data sets of real-time information, like the knowledge graph, the shopping graph, and in this case, local data, including insights from our maps community of over 500 million contributors.

495
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:13,760
Search pulls together a response and it checks its work to make sure it meets our high bar for information quality.

496
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:18,560
And if it detects any gaps, it issues even more searches to fill them in.

497
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,680
That means with AI mode, you get all of this from just a single search.

498
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,280
And you get it fast.

499
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,560
Now let's take a look at what's coming next to AI Mode, starting in labs.

500
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:39,600
Soon AI Mode will be able to make your responses even more helpful with personalized suggestions based on your past searches.

501
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,920
You can also opt in to connect other Google Apps, starting with email.

502
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,320
We call this personal context, and you'll see when AI Mode is bringing yours in to help.

503
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,640
So now, based on your recent restaurant bookings and searches, it gets that you prefer outdoor seating.

504
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,680
And since you subscribe to those gallery newsletters, it suggests some cool art exhibits to check out while you're in town.

505
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,520
But that's not all.

506
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,040
Because your flight and hotel confirmations are in your inbox.

507
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:14,960
You get event ideas that sync up with when you'll actually be in Nashville, with many nearby where you're staying.

508
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:22,880
You can see how personal context in AI mode makes search really yours, with recommendations customized just for you.

509
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,600
Now this is always under your control.

510
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,560
And you can choose to connect or disconnect at any time.

511
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,480
Personal context is coming to AI mode this summer.

512
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:47,920
Next, for questions when you want an even more thorough response, we're bringing deep research capabilities into AI mode.

513
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:54,720
You already come to search today to really unpack a topic, but this brings it to a much deeper level.

514
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,760
So much so that we're calling this deep search.

515
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,520
Deep search uses the same query fan out technique you just heard about, but multiplied.

516
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:08,160
It can issue dozens or even hundreds of searches on your behalf.

517
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:15,680
It reasons across all those disparate pieces of information to create an expert-level, fully cited report in just minutes.

518
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,200
It includes links to the web throughout, so you can easily explore and take action.

519
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,800
Now that's a core part of how we've built AI mode overall, and how we've always thought about AI and search.

520
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,720
Because we believe AI will be the most powerful engine for discovery that the web has ever seen.

521
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:42,000
Helping people discover even more of what the web has to offer and finding credible, hyper-relevant content.

522
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,160
You're starting to see how search is becoming more intelligent, and we've got more to show you.

523
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:56,160
So I'll hand it over to Raja, who will share how AI Mode is helping analyze complex data for one of his passions, sports.

524
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,760
Thanks, Louis.

525
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,200
Okay, so I'm a huge baseball fan.

526
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,120
And lately, there's been a lot of buzz about these new torpedo bats.

527
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:21,920
If you don't follow baseball, it's a new bat design where more of the weight of the bat is in the sweet spot.

528
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,960
As you can see, I've been digging in on whether it's making a real impact on the game.

529
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,920
And now, I'm wondering what the numbers say.

530
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:39,280
So I'll ask, show the batting average and on-base percentage for this season and last for notable players who currently use a torpedo bat.

531
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,320
Think about it.

532
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,040
There are so many parts to that question.

533
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:50,320
Search needs to understand who the notable players are, which ones are using torpedo bats, and their stats.

534
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,200
I get this helpful response, including this easy to read table.

535
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:04,240
And I know that this is fresh and accurate since it uses our sports data that's continuously updated down to the last strike.

536
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:09,920
Search even brings in important context, like that it's still early in the season.

537
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,200
I can follow up and ask, how many home runs have these players hit this season?

538
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,400
And just like that, I get this graph.

539
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:26,160
This goes back to what Liz mentioned about AI mode dynamically generating the right UI for each response.

540
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:32,400
Search figured out that the best way to present this information is a graph, and it created it.

541
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,640
It's like having my very own sports analyst write in search.

542
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:44,160
Complex analysis and data visualization is coming this summer for sports and financial questions.

543
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:57,920
Okay, so all this talk about baseball made me want to get closer to the game, like at the next game close.

544
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,600
But finding the perfect tickets can be a chore.

545
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:09,360
So I'm excited to share that we're bringing Project Mariner's agentic capabilities into AI mode.

546
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,920
You've already seen how AI mode is becoming more intelligent and personalized.

547
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,600
And here's where you start to see search getting more agentic.

548
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:22,640
Search can take work off my plate while still under my control.

549
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,960
I'll say, find two affordable tickets for this Saturday's Reds game in the lower level.

550
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:41,520
Search kicks off a query fan out, looking across several sites to analyze hundreds of potential ticket options, doing the tedious work of filling in forms with all the criteria I asked for.

551
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:48,640
And it puts it all together, reasoning across the results to analyze real-time pricing and inventory.

552
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,960
Then, right here, task complete.

553
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,200
I get great ticket options with helpful context so I can make an informed decision.

554
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,280
Looks like these seats have a good view and at a reasonable price.

555
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:08,640
Search helps me skip a bunch of steps, linking me right to finish checking out.

556
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,720
Tickets secured.

557
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:26,640
Search will help with tasks like this soon, starting with event tickets, restaurant reservations, and appointments for local services.

558
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,440
Next, let's talk about multimodality.

559
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,480
We've been blazing the trail for a multimodal search since before it was really even a thing.

560
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,880
We introduced Google Lens on this very stage back in 2017.

561
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,680
And since then, we've made it even easier to see search what you see.

562
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,160
Snap a picture with Google Lens or simply circle the search and you can get an AI overview instantly.

563
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,760
Like Sundarb mentioned, visual search is on fire.

564
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:02,640
And today, I'm excited to share that Lens has over 1.5 billion users every month.

565
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:16,560
Now, we're taking the next big leap in multimodality by bringing Project Astra's live capabilities into AI mode.

566
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:22,960
Think about all those questions that are so much simpler to just talk through and actually show what you mean.

567
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,640
Like a DIY home repair, a tricky school assignment, or learning a new skill.

568
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,720
We call this Search Live.

569
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:39,040
And now, using your camera, Search can see what you see and give you helpful information as you go back and forth in real time.

570
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,400
It's like hopping on a video call with Search.

571
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:47,040
I have three kids, and they ask about a million questions a minute.

572
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:57,600
And with summer right around the corner, the team and I decided to put Search Live to the ultimate test, helping us and our kids tackle something new.

573
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,840
We recorded at home with our families just this past weekend.

574
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,520
Let's take a look.

575
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,800
It looks like you're about to do a fun science experiment.

576
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:07,440
All right.

577
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,400
Ready, Anya?

578
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,200
Ready, Adi?

579
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:09,600
Yep.

580
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,240
Okay.

581
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,320
Are you ready for your scientific experiment?

582
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:12,720
Yeah.

583
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,440
Can you guess which experiment I'm trying to do?

584
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,240
I have hydrogen peroxide and dist soap and yeast.

585
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,320
You're likely going to make elephant tooth mixed.

586
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,960
How do I know which one of these strawberries is ready to eat?

587
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,200
I'm trying to get this remote to work.

588
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,200
It looks like someone is ready to get their hands dirty and plant a green bean seedling.

589
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:33,040
Up into about 50 pounds per square inch, but don't go over 90 psi.

590
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,720
I mixed baking soda.

591
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,520
What do I do next?

592
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,640
It looks like someone tried dipping a finger into the sense of the water.

593
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,800
What should I do to make this even more impressive?

594
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,800
Try using a different catalyst.

595
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,280
Potassium iodide is a good option.

596
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,800
Why is it doing that?

597
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,520
A ripe strawberry will also have a sweet spell.

598
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,160
The green leaves at the top should look fresh and vibrant.

599
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,000
The chemical reaction is beautiful.

600
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,120
This is awesome.

601
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,080
Thanks.

602
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:01,920
Oh boy.

603
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,240
How do I get strawberry stains out of a shirt?

604
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:09,680
Try using a mix of one tablespoon white vinegar, half a teaspoon liquid laundry detergent.

605
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:30,560
With AI mode, we are bringing a new level of intelligence to help you shop with Google.

606
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:37,680
As you heard earlier, AI mode brings in information from the web and our real-time data.

607
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:55,040
In this case, that means you get the visual inspiration of Google Images and the world's most comprehensive set of products and retailers from our shopping graph, which has over 50 billion product listings that get constantly updated.

608
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,240
Let me show you how this comes together.

609
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:02,400
So I have been on the hunt for a new rug for my living room.

610
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:09,680
I'll say I have a light grey couch and I'm looking for a rug to brighten the room.

611
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,280
What I need first is visual inspiration.

612
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:22,560
Search dynamically generates a browsable mosaic of images and some shoppable products personalized just for me.

613
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:30,560
I see rugs from some of my go-to brands and some more modern options since I often search for things in that style.

614
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:37,840
Now, these are nice, but I know most of them wouldn't survive a day in my home.

615
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:47,040
So I'll add, I have four active kids and they like to have friends over.

616
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,840
Search understands this involves plenty of messes.

617
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:59,520
It recommends a low-pile and washable rug made from durable materials along with some products that I can shop.

618
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:06,320
But I don't know a lot about drugs, so luckily, search points out some things to consider.

619
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:15,360
And with helpful follow-ups like these, taking a few days of research down to just a few minutes.

620
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:23,360
You can imagine how helpful this new experience in AI mode will be for all of your shopping needs.

621
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,520
Speaking of, I want a few new dresses for summer.

622
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:36,720
Search gave me some great options, but now I'm faced with the classic online shopping dilemma.

623
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:41,200
I have no clue how these styles will look on me.

624
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:52,160
So we are introducing a new try-on feature that will help you virtually try on clothes so you get a feel for how styles might look on you.

625
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,480
Let me show you a live demo.

626
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:56,800
Okay.

627
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:02,800
So I looked at many dresses and I really like this blue one.

628
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,440
I click on this button to try it on.

629
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:10,480
It asks me to upload a picture which takes me to my camera role.

630
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,080
I have many pictures here.

631
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:18,800
I'm going to pick one that is full length and a clear view of me and off it goes.

632
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,600
While it's processing, I'll show you what's happening behind the scenes.

633
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:32,640
To create a try-on experience that works at scale, we need a deep understanding of the human body and how clothing looks on it.

634
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:39,440
To do this, we built a custom image generation model specifically trained for fashion.

635
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,520
Wow, and it's back.

636
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:54,000
I have to say I love a live demo when it works.

637
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,160
Alright, more on how it works.

638
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:08,960
It brings in advanced 3D shape understanding, which allows us to perceive shapes and depths more accurately, helping us better visualize the human body.

639
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,080
Our try-on experience works with your photo.

640
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,400
It's not some pre-captured image or a model that doesn't look like you.

641
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:27,280
And then, when it comes to clothes that you are interested in, the AI model is able to show how this material will fold and stretch and drape on people.

642
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:39,040
This technology is the most state-of-the-art in the industry at scale and it allows us to visualize how billions of apparel products look on a wide variety of people.

643
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:44,640
And you can see it here, how it really gives me a feel for how this dress might look on me.

644
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,680
Alright, so I'm now set on the dress.

645
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:55,120
And search can help me find it at the price that I want and buy it for me with our new agentic checkout feature.

646
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,240
So let me get back here to the dress.

647
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,480
And I'm going to click this thing to track price.

648
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,880
I pick my size.

649
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,040
Then I have to set a target price.

650
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,520
I'm going to set it to about $50.

651
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,920
And tracking is happening.

652
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:21,040
Search will now continuously check websites where the dress is available and then let me know if the price drops.

653
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,720
So now let's switch out of our live demo mode.

654
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,520
And then I'm going to sprinkle some IO magic.

655
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:30,000
And let's assume the price is now dropped.

656
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,280
When that happens, I get a notification just like this.

657
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:41,920
And if I want to buy, my checkout agent will add the right size and color to my cart.

658
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:48,960
I can choose to review all my payment and shipping information or just let the agent just buy it for me.

659
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:03,600
With just one tap, search, securely buys it for me with Google Pay.

660
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,800
And of course, all of this happen under my guidance.

661
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,320
From inspiration to purchase.

662
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:18,160
Our new intelligent capabilities bring the best of shopping together with the best of AI right here in search.

663
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:23,760
Our new visual shopping and agentic checkout features are rolling out in the coming months.

664
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:28,880
And you can start trying on looks in labs beginning today.

665
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,840
And now, back to you, Liz.

666
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,040
Thanks, Vidya.

667
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:59,040
As Sunder mentioned, this all gets an even bigger upgrade later this week when we bring a custom version of Gemini 2.5 to both AI overviews and AI mode.

668
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:08,800
This is the next frontier of Google Search, where AI overviews bring the helpfulness of AI to everyone in the main search experience.

669
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:18,160
And as you've seen today, AI mode is a totally reimagined AI search with all our most cutting-edge AI features and capabilities.

670
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:24,400
We couldn't be more excited about this chapter of Google Search, where you can truly ask anything.

671
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,880
And we mean anything.

672
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:36,800
Your simplest and your hardest questions, your deepest research, your personalized shopping needs, your just take it off my plate tasks.

673
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,280
All you have to do is ask.

674
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,360
Now here we go.

675
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:50,400
I can't help it if I pop and see them watch my wage out as favor bad and sugar.

676
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,040
Baby, you LOUS every day like that.

677
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:24,880
If you wanna go get no disrespect for years, people have pursued building an AI assistant that doesn't just respond, but understands.

678
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,560
One that doesn't just wait, but anticipate.

679
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,560
A truly universal assistant that empowers you.

680
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:39,360
And today, we're taking a new step forward to that future, and we're using the Gemini app to get there.

681
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:47,280
Our goal is to make Gemini the most personal, proactive, and powerful AI assistant.

682
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,920
And it starts with being personal.

683
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,760
What if your AI assistant was truly yours?

684
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:54,960
Truly yours.

685
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:00,560
An assistant that learns you, your preferences, your projects, your world.

686
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,520
And you were always in the driver's seat.

687
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:10,560
And with your permission, you could share relevant Google information with it, making it an extension of you.

688
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,600
We call this personal context.

689
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:23,920
And we've already made it possible for you to connect your search history with Gemini so it can understand that you've searched for recipes in the past and craft responses like this.

690
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:30,640
Starting soon, you'll be able to add even more personal context from across Google to Gemini.

691
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,440
So it will be uniquely helpful.

692
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,920
You can choose to turn this on and you'll always be in control of the experience.

693
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:43,760
You can view and manage your information as well as connect and disconnect different Google apps.

694
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:49,200
This level of personalization gives you a more proactive AI assistant.

695
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,360
And this changes a lot.

696
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,640
See, today, Boast AI is reactive.

697
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,040
You ask, it answers.

698
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:02,720
But what if it could see what's coming and help you prepare even before you ask?

699
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,800
Imagine you're a student.

700
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,960
You've got a big physics exam looming.

701
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:11,680
And instead of scrambling, Gemini sees it on your calendar, a week out.

702
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,680
But it doesn't just remind you.

703
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:21,760
It comes with personalized quizzes crafted from your materials, notes from your professor, even photos, handwritten notes.

704
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,440
That's not just helpful.

705
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,760
It's going to feel like magic.

706
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:36,880
And imagine the step beyond that, where Gemini can go off and make custom explainer videos based on your interests so you can understand a topic better.

707
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,320
In this case, Gemini knows that I'm into cycling.

708
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:45,440
So it explains this concept of thermodynamics to me using an analogy I'll understand.

709
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,480
This is where we're headed with Gemini.

710
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:54,320
And it's all possible because of the powerful capabilities in the underlying model.

711
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,480
Last month, we shipped our latest 2.5 Pro model in the Gemini app.

712
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,520
And it wasn't just an upgrade, it was a leap forward.

713
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,720
People are doing extraordinary things in the app.

714
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:11,120
They're not just vibe coding, they're inventing entire games and making fully featured websites in minutes.

715
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,000
They're thinking things into existence.

716
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:21,200
And it's fun to write software for the first time or create a video with our VO model, to generate and edit images.

717
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,440
It's a new superpower for everyone.

718
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:32,000
And so these three Ps, personal, proactive, and powerful, these are the frontiers of AI assistance.

719
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:36,640
And thanks to 2.5 Pro, we're making big strides across all three.

720
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,320
So let's talk more about how all this is coming together to life in the Gemini app.

721
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,560
We're launching five things today.

722
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,200
First, let's talk about Gemini Live.

723
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,240
People are blown away by how interactive and natural the conversations are.

724
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,640
And it works in over 45 languages, more than 150 countries.

725
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,280
It's so intuitive, so engaging.

726
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,800
The conversations, in fact, are five times longer than the text conversations in the app.

727
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:11,680
And I can tell you from personal experience, it's great for talking through things on the drive into work in the morning.

728
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:18,080
Now, as Sundar mentioned, Gemini Live now includes camera and screen sharing, both of which are incredible.

729
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:23,440
All of it is rolling out free of charge in the Gemini app on Android and iOS today.

730
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:36,960
And in the coming weeks, you'll be able to connect Gemini Live to some of your favorite apps, like calendar, maps, keep, tasks.

731
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:43,680
So soon, you can just point your camera and ask it to add an invite to your calendar, and it'll be done.

732
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:52,720
Or if you need to decipher your roommate's handwriting for the shopping list, Gemini Live can turn those scribbles into a neat list in Google Keep.

733
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:57,200
Our Gemini Rella Live roadmap is overflowing with exciting things.

734
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,360
They're all being prototyped in Project Astra, like you saw earlier.

735
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:06,480
And as those ideas mature, we'll graduate them into Gemini Live for everyone.

736
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:15,680
And since Gemini and Android work so closely together, many of those experiences will work great on Android across the entire ecosystem.

737
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,680
So stay tuned for more.

738
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:25,440
All right, real-time interaction is amazing, but sometimes you need to go deep, unravel something complex.

739
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,920
This is where deep research comes in.

740
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:37,200
Starting today, deep research will now let you upload your own files to guide the research agent, which is one of the top requested features.

741
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,520
And soon will let you research across Google Drive and Gmail.

742
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,640
So you can easily pull in information from there too.

743
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,240
So let's say you have this incredible detailed report.

744
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:52,640
In this case, it's about the science of comets moving throughout space.

745
01:16:53,120 --> 01:17:00,160
How do you get all that brilliance distilled down into something digestible, engaging, something you can share?

746
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,160
This is where Canvas comes in.

747
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,760
It's Gemini's interactive space for co-creation.

748
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:19,360
Canvas will now let you transform that report with one tap into all kinds of new things, like a dynamic web page, an infographic, a helpful quiz, even a custom podcast in 45 languages.

749
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:27,360
But if you want to go further, you can vibe code all sorts of amazing things in Canvas with as much back and forth as you want.

750
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,400
You can get exactly the experience you're looking for.

751
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:40,480
Check out this interactive comment simulation that one of our Googlers made just by describing what they wanted to build and collaborating with Gemini to get it just right.

752
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:47,040
And as you can share apps like this, others can easily jump in and view it and modify it and remix it.

753
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,560
This is the power to transform anything.

754
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,920
And it's a whole new way to use Gemini.

755
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,840
There's another new way you can use Gemini today too.

756
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,960
We're introducing Gemini in Chrome.

757
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:07,360
This will be your AI assistant that's there for you as you browse the web on your desktop.

758
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:14,560
The amazing part is that you can use this and it understands the context of the page that you're on automatically.

759
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,760
So if you have a question, it can be answered.

760
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:23,440
I especially love it for comparing reviews on long pages like this camping website.

761
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:29,200
We're starting to roll out Gemini and Chrome this week to Gemini subscribers in the US.

762
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:41,520
All right, we've taken some quizzes, we've talked to Gemini live, we've learned about comments and campsites.

763
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,760
Now it's time to create some things.

764
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:51,440
Starting today, we're bringing our latest and most capable image generation model into the Gemini app.

765
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,920
It's called Imagine 4, and it's a big leap forward.

766
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:06,160
The images are richer with more nuanced colors and fine-grained details.

767
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:11,200
The shadows in the different shots, the water droplets that come through in the photos.

768
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:21,440
I've spent a lot of time around these models, and I can say this model and the progression has gone from good to great to stunning.

769
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,000
And Imagine 4 is so much better at text and topography.

770
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:33,120
In the past, you might have created something that looked good, but adding words didn't always work just right.

771
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,480
So check this out.

772
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,440
Maybe I want to create a poster for a music festival.

773
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,080
We'll make the Chrome Dyno the big headliner.

774
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:55,120
Imagine 4 doesn't just get the text and spelling right, it's actually making creative choices, like using dinosaur bones in the font, or figuring out the spacing, the font size, the layout that makes it look like this great poster.

775
01:19:55,440 --> 01:20:00,160
So the image quality is higher, the speed is faster, the text is better.

776
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:05,280
All of this lets you make posters, party invites, and anything else.

777
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:11,360
And with Gemini's native image generation, you can easily edit these images too, right in the app.

778
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,080
We've also made a super fast variant of Imagine 4.

779
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,320
We can't wait for you to get your hands on it.

780
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,320
In fact, it's 10 times faster than our previous model.

781
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,680
So you can iterate through many ideas quickly.

782
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,480
All right, I want to show you one last thing.

783
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:35,440
Images are incredible, but sometimes you need motion and sound to tell the whole story.

784
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:42,080
Last December, VO2 came out and it redefined video generation for the industry.

785
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:48,400
And if you saw Dennis' sizzling onions post yesterday, you know that we've been cooking something else.

786
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:54,720
Today, I'm excited to announce our new state-of-the-art model, VO3.

787
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,960
And like a lot of other things you've heard about from Stage Today, it's available today.

788
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,240
The visual quality is even better.

789
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,520
Its understanding of physics is stronger.

790
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,440
But here's the leap forward.

791
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:23,600
V03 comes with native audio generation.

792
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:33,920
That means that VO3 can generate sound effects, background sounds, and dialogue.

793
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,680
Now you prompt it, and your characters can speak.

794
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,640
Here's a wise old owl and a nervous young badger in the forest.

795
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:43,760
Take a listen.

796
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,320
They left behind a ball today.

797
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,560
It bounced higher than I can jump.

798
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,680
What manner of magic is that?

799
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,000
Pretty cool, right?

800
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:20,640
Villo added not just the sounds of the forest, but also the dialogue.

801
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:28,720
We're entering a new era of creation with combined audio and video generation that's incredibly realistic.

802
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:35,600
The quality is so good, it feels like you're there on the boat with this guy.

803
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:41,360
This ocean, it's a force, a wild, untamed mite.

804
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,520
And she commands your awe with every breaking light.

805
01:22:52,640 --> 01:23:06,320
The photorealistic generation, the emotion, the movement of his mouth and the ocean in the background, it's incredible how fast VO continues to evolve as a powerful creative tool.

806
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:12,320
And we've been working closely with the film industry to imagine what's possible with VO and to get this right.

807
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:15,360
And you'll hear more about that in a few minutes.

808
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:18,160
So that's what's happening around Gemini.

809
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:24,720
Starting today, Gemini Live capabilities are free and rolling out across Android and iOS.

810
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:29,120
Deep Research and Canvas are getting their biggest updates yet.

811
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:33,760
There's a new agent mode coming for multi-step actions that you heard about earlier.

812
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:45,120
We're introducing Gemini and Chrome to help you navigate the web, and you can create stunning images and videos with sound using the new Imagine4 and VO3 models.

813
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:54,800
It's all coming together in the Gemini app as we work to deliver the most personal, proactive, and powerful AI assistant.

814
01:23:55,120 --> 01:24:01,840
And now, to go into more detail about how these generative models are unlocking creative expression, here's Jason.

815
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,600
Thanks, Josh.

816
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:22,080
Whether you're a creator, a musician, or a filmmaker, generative media is expanding the boundaries of creativity.

817
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:30,320
By working closely with the artistic community since the very beginning, we continue to build technology that empowers their creative process.

818
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:35,200
For example, we worked with musicians to develop Music AI Sandbox.

819
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:41,840
It's a tool for professionals to explore the possibilities of our generative music model, Lyria, in their work.

820
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:51,120
Let's watch a clip starring the legendary Grammy Award-winning singer and composer Shankar Mahadevan putting Music AI Sandbox and Lyria to use.

821
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:58,320
I'm Shankar Mahadevan and I'm a music composer, singer, producer, and a happy man.

822
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,640
Working with Sandbox is great.

823
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:07,360
We inputted our requirement and it gave us a bed.

824
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,240
We used that bed and we came up with the song.

825
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,520
For a musician, it's such an inspiring tool.

826
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,320
You open a door and you see, hey, there's another room there.

827
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,200
And then you open one more door and you say, one more room there.

828
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,720
So that's what AI does.

829
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,480
Amazing.

830
01:25:56,320 --> 01:26:01,920
We recently launched Lyria 2, which can generate high-fidelity music and professional grade audio.

831
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:06,800
The music is melodious, with vocals in solos and choirs.

832
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,640
As you hear, it makes expressive and rich music.

833
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:32,720
Lyria 2 is available today for enterprises, YouTube creators, and musicians.

834
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:37,600
This focus on collaboration carries over not just into what we build, but how.

835
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:43,920
Right now, it's not easy for people or organizations to detect AI-generated images.

836
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:51,840
This will become only more true as technology improves and the music, audio, images, and videos become more lifelike.

837
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:55,680
So, we're continuing to innovate in this space.

838
01:26:56,240 --> 01:27:02,160
Two years ago, we pioneered SynthID, which embeds invisible watermarks into generated media.

839
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:07,680
To date, over 10 billion pieces of content have been watermarked.

840
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:15,760
We're also expanding our partnerships to ensure that more content is watermarked with SynthID and that more organizations can detect it too.

841
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:20,240
Finally, we're also making it easier to detect the watermark.

842
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:30,160
Our new SynthID detector can identify if an image, audio track, text, or video has SynthID in it, whether it's in the whole piece or even just a part.

843
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,920
We're starting to roll this out to early testers today.

844
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:44,800
Our collaboration efforts have also helped us explore Vio as a filmmaking tool.

845
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:58,400
Recently, we teamed up with Visionary Director Darren Aronowski and his new storytelling venture, Primordial Soup, to shape Vio's capabilities to meet the needs of storytellers, putting artists in the driver's seat of innovation.

846
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:09,360
Together, we are putting the world's best video generation model into the hands of top filmmakers to push the boundaries of technology as a tool for more creative and emotional storytelling.

847
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:15,200
The first of the partnership's three short films is director Eliza McNitz and Sestra.

848
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,120
Let's take a peek.

849
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:24,800
Film has always been this deeply human act of connecting people with each other's stories.

850
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:31,520
And it has the ability to rip us out of our experience and take us on another journey.

851
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,000
I don't think that ever changes.

852
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:38,960
This is a story that traverses the entire history of the universe.

853
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:45,280
But it's really about a mom and what happens when her child is born with a hole in her heart.

854
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:53,360
We filmed really emotional performances, but then generated video we could never capture otherwise.

855
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,760
I want the baby to be holding the mother's finger.

856
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,600
Just the bliss of the two of them.

857
01:28:59,760 --> 01:28:59,920
Yeah.

858
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:08,880
Video is a generative video model, but to me, it's another lens through which I get to imagine the universe around me.

859
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:18,400
It's been incredibly interesting to see the strengths of these models, the limits of the models, and try to shape them to make storytelling tools.

860
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:25,440
To be honest, I never thought about telling the story of the day I was born, but here we are.

861
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,040
This was supposed to be a checkup.

862
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,240
Crash C-section!

863
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,320
Baby's in distress.

864
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:37,280
We need help here.

865
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:38,160
We need to go.

866
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:39,600
Is my baby gonna be okay?

867
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:40,960
We're gonna do everything we can.

868
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,400
Am I gonna be okay?

869
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,440
For every creature that came before you.

870
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:51,200
From every star that died, so that you could begin.

871
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,400
Incredible work.

872
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:27,440
Eliza combined live-action performance with video-generated video, like the microscopic worlds, the cosmic events, and herself as a newborn.

873
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:37,120
This approach opened up completely new storytelling possibilities, empowering Eliza to bring cinematic scale and emotion to a deeply personal story.

874
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:44,000
This partnership also helped shape Vio's capabilities to meet the needs of storytellers like Eliza.

875
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:54,880
We built new capabilities for filmmakers, so when you're making a video, it will use ingredients you give it, characters, scenes, or styles, and keep them consistent.

876
01:30:55,120 --> 01:31:01,520
Or you can direct Vio, giving it precise camera instructions and have it shoot along a specific path.

877
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:07,280
These capabilities help filmmakers fluidly express their ideas with Vio.

878
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,320
We then took things one step further.

879
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:13,440
To tell you more, let's get Josh back out here.

880
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,920
Thanks, Jason.

881
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:29,920
Based on our collaboration with the creative community, we've been building a new AI filmmaking tool for creatives.

882
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:34,880
One that combines the best of VO, Imagine, and Gemini.

883
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:39,360
A tool built for creatives, by creatives.

884
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:46,160
It's inspired by that magical feeling you get when you get lost in the creative zone and time slows down.

885
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:49,920
We're calling it Flow, and it's launching today.

886
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,320
Let me show you how it works.

887
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:56,240
Let's drop into a project I'm working on.

888
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:01,840
Our hero, the grandpa, is building a flying car with help from a feathered friend.

889
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:05,760
These are my ingredients, the old man and his car.

890
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:13,840
We make it easy to upload your own images into the tool, or you can generate them on the fly using Imagine, which is built right in.

891
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:19,120
We can create a custom gold gear shift just by describing it.

892
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,000
There it is.

893
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,520
Pretty cool.

894
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,840
Next, you can start to assemble all of those clips together.

895
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:32,080
With a single prompt, you can describe what you want, including very precise camera controls.

896
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,960
Flow puts everything in place.

897
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,000
And I can keep iterating in the scene builder.

898
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,240
Now, here's where it gets really exciting.

899
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:46,800
If I want to capture the next shot of the scene, I can just hit the plus icon to create the next shot.

900
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:52,800
I can describe what I want to happen next, like adding a 10-foot tall chicken in the back seat.

901
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,720
And Flow will do the rest.

902
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:59,520
The character consistency, the scene consistency, it just works.

903
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:03,040
And if something isn't, oh, quite right, no problem.

904
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:09,280
You can just go back in like any other video tool and trim it up if it's not working for you.

905
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,560
But Flow works in the other direction as well.

906
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,440
It lets you extend a clip too.

907
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,680
So I can get the perfect ending that I've been working towards.

908
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,440
Once I've got all the clips I need, I can download the files.

909
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:33,040
I can bring them into my favorite editing software, add some music from Lyria, and now the old man finally has his flying car.

910
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:56,880
Pretty awesome.

911
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,760
Pretty awesome.

912
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:08,480
I want you to hear just a few words from a few of our AI filmmakers who we've been working with to shape flow, how they describe how it feels using it, and how they're making it even better.

913
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,160
Let's take a watch.

914
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:17,680
I don't know if I'm on the right path, but I'm trying to find it.

915
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:23,520
I'm questioning, searching, and then something shifts.

916
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,840
And I'm not trying anymore.

917
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:26,960
I'm just doing.

918
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:35,600
And all of the pieces start falling into place.

919
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,160
It all feels pretty clear in my head.

920
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:46,320
I see these like flashes of possibilities.

921
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:49,040
Almost like I'm traveling through dimensions.

922
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:59,040
I'm looking down at myself and my characters in these different worlds, and it's almost coming to life on their own, even though I know I'm in control of that narrative.

923
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:03,920
It feels like it's almost building upon itself at some point.

924
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:09,840
You know, you could have an infinite amount of endings to your story.

925
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:15,280
So the work isn't quick by brick by brick.

926
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:19,760
It blooms like Spatina's garden.

927
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:25,040
It grows naturally, fully vibrant and complete.

928
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,840
I'm not forcing it.

929
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,960
I'm just finding it.

930
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:34,240
And that's when I know I'm in the right place.

931
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:59,600
So amazing to hear those filmmakers talk about bringing their incredible visions to life.

932
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:05,600
And that feeling of building, of creating, that's exactly what we want to put in your hands today.

933
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:11,440
So I'm excited to share that we're upgrading two AI subscription plans today.

934
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:16,880
We will have Google AI Pro and the all-new Google AI Ultra.

935
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:27,680
With the Pro plan, which is going to be available globally, you'll get a full suite of AI products with higher rate limits and special features compared to the free version.

936
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:34,000
This includes the Pro version of the Gemini app that was formerly known as Gemini Advanced.

937
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,320
Then there's the Ultra plan.

938
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:43,600
It's for the trailblazers, the pioneers, those of you who want cutting-edge AI from Google.

939
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:51,360
The plan comes with the highest rate limits, the earliest access to new features and products from across Google.

940
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:56,560
It's available in the US today, and we'll be rolling it out globally soon.

941
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:01,280
You can think of this ultra plan as your VIP pass for Google AI.

942
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:11,200
So if you're an ultra subscriber, you'll get huge rate limits and access to that 2.5 Pro deep think mode in the Gemini app when it's ready.

943
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:16,000
You'll get access to Flow with VO3 available today.

944
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:21,040
And it also comes with YouTube Premium and a massive amount of storage.

945
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:27,840
We can't wait to see what you build, create, and discover with these new Google AI plans.

946
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:36,320
And now, to give you a look ahead into how AI is interacting with the physical world, please welcome up Sharam.

947
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,440
Hi, everyone.

948
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:56,160
There's so many exciting things happening in Android right now.

949
01:37:56,640 --> 01:38:00,080
It's the platform where you see the future first.

950
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:10,320
Just last week at the Android show, we unveiled a bold new design and major updates to Android 16 and WearOS 6.

951
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:15,360
And of course, Android is the best place to experience AI.

952
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:21,440
Many of the Gemini breakthroughs you saw today are coming soon to Android.

953
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:25,600
You can already access Gemini instantly from the Power button.

954
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,520
It understands your context and is ready to help.

955
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:32,720
But Android is powering more than your phone.

956
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:36,080
It's an entire ecosystem of devices.

957
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:44,480
In the coming months, we're bringing Gemini to your watch, your car's dashboard, even your TV.

958
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:51,280
So wherever you are, you have a helpful AI assistant to make your life easier.

959
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:58,960
But what about emerging form factors that could let you experience an AI assistant in new ways?

960
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:03,120
That's exactly why we're building Android XR.

961
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:23,520
It's the first Android platform built in the Gemini era, and it supports a broad spectrum of devices for different use cases, from headsets to glasses, and everything in between.

962
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:30,640
We believe there's not a one-size-fits-all for XR, and you'll use different devices throughout your day.

963
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:39,200
For example, for watching movies, playing games, or getting work done, you'll want an immersive headset.

964
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:47,360
But when you're on the go, you'll want lightweight glasses that can give you timely information without reaching for your phone.

965
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:55,600
We built Android XR together as one team with Samsung and optimized it for Snapdragon with Qualcomm.

966
01:39:55,920 --> 01:40:03,120
Since releasing the Android XR developer preview last year, hundreds of developers are building for the platform.

967
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:08,080
We're also reimagining all your favorite Google apps for XR.

968
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:13,520
And it's Android after all, so your mobile and tablet apps work too.

969
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:22,080
Now, today, I want to share how Gemini transforms the way you experience both headsets and glasses.

970
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:31,200
On these devices, your AI assistant understands your context and intent in richer ways to help you throughout your day.

971
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:34,560
Let's start with Gemini on headsets.

972
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:40,560
This is Samsung's Project Muhan, the first Android XR device.

973
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:52,880
Muhan gives you an infinite screen to explore your apps with Gemini by your side.

974
01:40:53,200 --> 01:41:00,880
With Google Maps and XR, you can teleport anywhere in the world simply by asking Gemini to take you there.

975
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:10,480
You can talk with your AI assistant about anything you see and have it pull up videos and websites about what you're exploring.

976
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:15,520
So many of us dream about sitting front row to watch our favorite team.

977
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:26,160
Imagine watching them play in the MLB app as if you were right there in the stadium while chatting with Gemini about player and game stats.

978
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:31,840
Samsung's Project Muhan will be available for purchase later this year.

979
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,920
We can't wait for you to try it for yourselves.

980
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:40,960
Now, let's turn our attention to glasses.

981
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:47,920
As you know, we've been building glasses for over 10 years and we've never stopped.

982
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:56,720
Glasses with Android XR are lightweight and designed for all-day wear, even though they're packed with technology.

983
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:03,120
A camera and microphones give Gemini the ability to see and hear the world.

984
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:07,920
Speakers let you listen to the AI, play music, or take calls.

985
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:14,880
And an optional in-lens display privately shows you helpful information just when you need it.

986
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:21,600
These glasses work with your phone, giving you access to your apps while keeping your hands free.

987
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:30,000
All this makes glasses a natural form factor for AI, bringing the power of Gemini right to where you are.

988
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:36,480
So, unlike Clark Kent, you can get superpowers when you put your glasses on.

989
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,040
Okay, who's up for seeing an early demo of Android XR glasses?

990
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:55,360
Let's see how they work in the most hectic environment possible right now, backstage at I.O.

991
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,680
Our very own superwoman, Nishta, is back there to show us how these glasses work for real.

992
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:05,440
Let me send her a text now, and let's get started.

993
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,240
Hey, everyone.

994
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:16,000
Right now, you should be seeing exactly what I'm seeing through the lens of my Android XR glasses.

995
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:20,480
Like my delicious coffee over here, and that text from Shram that just came in.

996
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:22,000
Let's see what he said.

997
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:28,800
All right, it's definitely showtime, so I'm going to launch Gemini and get us going.

998
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:34,720
Send Sharom a text that I'm getting started, and silence my notifications, please.

999
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:40,640
Okay, I've sent that message to him and muted all your notifications.

1000
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,400
Perfect.

1001
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,240
Oh, hey, Mishta.

1002
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,040
Hey, Dieter.

1003
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:48,800
I see the lights on on your glasses, so I think it's safe to say that we're live right now.

1004
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:51,040
Yes, we're officially on with the I.O.

1005
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:51,520
crew.

1006
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,240
Hey, everybody.

1007
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,600
It is pretty great to see I.O.

1008
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:54,240
from this angle.

1009
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:59,200
Mishta, you promised me I could get my own pair of Android XR glasses if I helped out back here.

1010
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:00,640
So what do you say?

1011
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:01,360
Of course.

1012
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,680
Let's get coffee after this and I'll bring you those glasses.

1013
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:04,160
Awesome.

1014
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:04,720
We'll see you then.

1015
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:05,200
Good luck.

1016
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,240
Thank you.

1017
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,080
As you all can see, there's a ton going on backstage.

1018
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:14,240
And is that pro basketball player, Giannis, wearing our glasses?

1019
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,520
I love them.

1020
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:18,480
It splits up both of my hands for double high fives.

1021
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:19,680
Nice.

1022
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:23,280
Let me keep showing you guys what these glasses can do.

1023
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:26,400
I've been curious about this photo wall all day.

1024
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:31,600
Like, what band is this, and how are they connected to this place?

1025
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:46,800
No way.

1026
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:49,920
Can you show me a photo of one of their performances here?

1027
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:52,880
Sure.

1028
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:53,680
Here's one.

1029
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,760
Want me to play one of their songs?

1030
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:56,720
I'd love that.

1031
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:59,200
I can listen while I make my way to the stage.

1032
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:03,120
Right.

1033
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:06,320
Here's Under the Aurora by Counting Crows.

1034
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,840
Okay, who's ready to see these glasses?

1035
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:12,000
Here comes the morning lady.

1036
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:14,640
Welcome, Mr.

1037
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:15,200
Hall.

1038
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,240
Hey, everyone.

1039
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,680
Thanks for that star-studded behind-the-scenes look.

1040
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,320
By the way, do you want to book that coffee with Dita now?

1041
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:29,840
Yes, the crew actually gave me some awesome coffee backstage, so let me try something fun.

1042
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:35,840
Gemini, what was the name of the coffee shop on the cup I had earlier?

1043
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,600
Hmm, that might have been Bloom's Giving.

1044
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,040
From what I can tell, it's a vibrant coffee shop on Castro Street.

1045
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:44,640
Great memory.

1046
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,880
Can you show me the photos of that cafe?

1047
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,800
I want to check out the vibes.

1048
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:57,680
Definitely.

1049
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,840
Do these photos from maps help?

1050
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:01,440
Oh, I know that spot.

1051
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:04,640
It's a flower shop as well as a coffee shop, but it is downtown.

1052
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:05,360
Hmm.

1053
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:05,920
Okay.

1054
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:08,880
Gemini, show me what it would take to walk here.

1055
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,520
Getting those directions now.

1056
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:16,000
It'll take you about an hour.

1057
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:16,640
Okay.

1058
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:24,720
I can get some stuffs in, and these heads-up directions and a full 3D map should make it super easy.

1059
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:38,720
Go ahead and send Dieter an invite for that cafe and get coffee at 3 p.m.

1060
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:39,120
today.

1061
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:44,160
I'll send out that invite now.

1062
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:45,680
Enjoy the coffee.

1063
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:59,600
As you saw, Gemini helped Nishta search what she sees, remember details like the coffee cup, book an event, even navigate, all without taking her phone out of her pocket.

1064
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:02,320
I'm even wearing the glasses right now too.

1065
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:07,920
They're my personal teleprompter, and I have prescription lenses, so I can see you all.

1066
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,040
Okay, Nishta, this is a big moment for glasses.

1067
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,080
Let's capture it.

1068
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:16,800
Yes, get ready for a quick photo, everyone, and let's bring out our star.

1069
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:19,760
Here comes the winter.

1070
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:23,600
All right, Gemini.

1071
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:26,960
Take a photo for me.

1072
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:39,840
All right, Gemini, take a photo for me and add it to my favorites.

1073
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,120
That looks amazing.

1074
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,480
I'm completely starstruck.

1075
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,720
Okay, one last thing.

1076
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:05,360
Sunda showed what's possible with live chat translation earlier.

1077
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:08,560
Let's see what that's like on glasses.

1078
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:12,720
This is a very risky demo, but we're going to give it a shot.

1079
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:17,920
Nishta and I are going to speak to each other in our mother tongues.

1080
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:19,760
Nishta's going to speak Hindi.

1081
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:22,960
I'm going to speak Farsi very poorly.

1082
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:27,120
And you'll see the feed from both of our glasses back here.

1083
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,120
And so you can all follow along.

1084
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:32,720
We'll show an English translation in real time.

1085
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:33,280
Okay?

1086
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:35,520
Let's give it a shot.

1087
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,120
Fingers crossed.

1088
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:57,760
I'm going to go to the house.

1089
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,400
We said it's a risky demo.

1090
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:28,880
Thank you, Jonah.

1091
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:42,800
Thank you, Mitter, for that awesome tour of Android XR glasses.

1092
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:56,240
We're so excited about the possibilities when you have an incredibly helpful AI assistant by your side with these Android XR devices.

1093
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:57,680
But that's not all.

1094
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:06,720
We're taking our partnership with Samsung to the next level by extending Android XR beyond headsets to glasses.

1095
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:15,760
We're creating the software and reference hardware platform to enable the ecosystem to build great glasses alongside us.

1096
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:25,120
Our glasses prototypes are already being used by trusted testers, and you'll be able to start developing for glasses later this year.

1097
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:31,680
Now, we know that these need to be stylish glasses that you'll want to wear all day.

1098
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:43,680
That's why I'm excited to announce today that Gentle Monster and Warby Parker will be the first eyewear partners to build glasses with Android XR.

1099
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:55,920
We want you to be able to wear glasses that match your personal taste.

1100
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:57,760
This is just the start.

1101
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:04,240
I can't wait for you to try Android XR for yourself, and we'll have lots more to share in the months ahead.

1102
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:06,080
Thank you so much.

1103
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,760
Those XR glasses are amazing.

1104
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:28,160
Research to reality, literally right in front of our eyes.

1105
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:30,800
Okay, so we are nearing the end of the show.

1106
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:36,960
Today you've heard a lot about ELO scores, benchmarks, and state-of-the-art performance.

1107
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:42,320
But I know there's one metric you've all been waiting for, our AI counter.

1108
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:46,080
So let's take a look at one last leaderboard.

1109
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:51,280
Looks like, I guess, we have a new entrant.

1110
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:56,080
Gemini takes the lead, coming in at 95.

1111
01:51:57,680 --> 01:51:59,680
Very exhilarating.

1112
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:12,160
On a more serious note, here's everything we've announced today, from new launches and product expansions to glimmers of what's to come.

1113
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:16,640
The opportunity with AI is truly as big as it gets.

1114
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:25,680
And it'll be up to this wave of developers, technology builders to make sure its benefits reach as many people as possible.

1115
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,360
I want to leave you with a few examples that inspire me.

1116
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:35,760
The first is top of mind for those who live here in California and so many places around the world.

1117
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:39,600
So many of us know someone who has been affected by wildfires.

1118
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:43,840
They can start suddenly and grow out of control in a matter of minutes.

1119
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:47,440
Speed and precision can make all the difference.

1120
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:52,480
Together, with an amazing group of partners, we are building something called FireSat.

1121
01:52:53,040 --> 01:53:01,840
It's a constellation of satellites that use multispectral satellite imagery and AI, aiming to provide near-real time insights.

1122
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:03,840
Just look at the resolution.

1123
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:10,800
It can detect fires as small as 270 square feet, about the size of a one-car garage.

1124
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:13,440
Our first satellite is in orbit now.

1125
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:23,680
When fully operational, imagery will be updated with a much greater frequency, down from every 12 hours today to every 20 minutes.

1126
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:35,040
Speed is also of the essence in other kinds of emergencies.

1127
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:43,600
During Hurricane Helene, Wing, in partnership with Walmart and the Red Cross, provided relief efforts with drone deliveries.

1128
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:53,040
Supported by AI, we were able to deliver critical items like food and medicine to a YMCA shelter in North Carolina based on real-time needs.

1129
01:53:53,280 --> 01:54:00,400
We can imagine how this could be helpful in disaster relief in other communities, and we are actively working to scale up.

1130
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:04,800
These are examples of ways AI is helping society right now.

1131
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:29,360
It's especially inspiring to think about the research of today that will become reality in a few short years, whether it's building the next generation of helpful robots, finding treatments for the world's deadliest diseases, advancing error-corrected quantum computers, or delivering fully autonomous vehicles that can safely bring you anywhere you want to go.

1132
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:33,600
All of this is very much possible within not decades, but years.

1133
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:35,280
It's amazing.

1134
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:39,680
This opportunity to improve lives is not something I take for granted.

1135
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,640
And the recent experience brought that home for me.

1136
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:45,440
I was in San Francisco with my parents.

1137
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:50,560
The first thing they wanted to do was to ride in a Waymo, like a lot of other tourists.

1138
01:54:50,880 --> 01:55:00,960
I had taken Waymos before, but watching my father, who's in his 80s in the front seat, be totally amazed, I saw the progress in a whole new light.

1139
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:08,480
It was a reminder of how incredible the power of technology is to inspire, to awe, and to move us forward.

1140
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:12,320
And I can't wait to see what amazing things we'll build together next.

1141
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:13,680
Thank you.

1142
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:30,880
What manner of magic is that?

1143
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:34,960
AI mode is the biggest revolution since the search engine was invented.

1144
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,600
Exactly what you want built.

1145
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:47,200
Project Mariner is going to change how we use our browsers.

1146
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:49,920
It's an AI agent that gets things done for you.

1147
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:53,200
Notebook elements mind now completely transformed for you.

1148
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:57,520
Just your shout out.

1149
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:03,840
AI 2.0 changing how we fight fires.

1150
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:07,360
Generative media is expanding the boundaries of creativity.

1151
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:09,360
That was magic the first time I thought it was.

1152
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:10,480
This is just another tool.

1153
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:11,360
It's a game changer.

1154
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:14,640
This is just like mind-blowing to the potential to make it.
