1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,300
[中文翻译]: Joining me now with the latest is NBC News and data correspondent Brian Chung

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,230
[中文翻译]: Brianthe markets don't seem to totally be sold on Trump's posts becoming a reality

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,640
[中文翻译]: Take us inside the numbers

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,900
[中文翻译]: what happened out there

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,450
[中文翻译]: Are they taking him seriously or literally or at all

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,830
[中文翻译]: Yeah

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,080
[中文翻译]: welllook

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,410
[中文翻译]: when you talk about the closing numbers

9
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,860
[中文翻译]: you could see them on the board ahead of you

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,600
[中文翻译]: The Dow Jones down six tenths of percent

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,570
[中文翻译]: The S&P 500

12
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,060
[中文翻译]: the more broad base index down 7 tenths of percent

13
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:31,200
[中文翻译]: And those tech head of these stocks were that would certainly include a heavier weighting on companies like Apple down a little bit more by 1%

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,730
[中文翻译]: But this isn't necessarily a Black Monday type of day

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,880
[中文翻译]: It's just simply a day where stocks ended marginally red

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,260
[中文翻译]: So I don't think that it's the market necessarily freaking out over what's going on with these announcements

17
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,050
[中文翻译]: But I do think

18
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,040
[中文翻译]: broadly speaking

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,730
[中文翻译]: there was this concern that

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,250
[中文翻译]: you know

21
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,260
[中文翻译]: lookwe had gotten over most of the crazy tariff headlines about a month ago

22
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,130
[中文翻译]: And after the 90 day pause and especially a de-escalation

23
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,330
[中文翻译]: especially with China

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,970
[中文翻译]: there was maybe some thought within Wall Street that maybe this was going to be a quieter summer

25
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,490
[中文翻译]: And then here you have Friday before Memorial Day weekend

26
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,290
[中文翻译]: the president kicking back up some of these tariff headlines

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,540
[中文翻译]: I do think that has the volatility perhaps coming back marginally to Wall Street

28
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,090
[中文翻译]: But again

29
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:14,520
[中文翻译]: the question here is what he's saying on truth social to be taken literally or figuratively

30
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,060
[中文翻译]: That is kind of the ongoing story with this administration

31
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,170
[中文翻译]: And that's something that Wall Street is going to have to grapple with as we continue to see these tariff threats going forward

32
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:21,590
[中文翻译]: Right

33
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,040
[中文翻译]: and then another confusing call by the president

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,530
[中文翻译]: He's called on Apple to make iPhones in the us or face a tariff

35
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,010
[中文翻译]: Is what he's calling for actually realistic

36
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,080
[中文翻译]: What exactly is he threatening here

37
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:33,300
[中文翻译]: Well

38
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,140
[中文翻译]: originally in the morning when he posted on Truth Social

39
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,500
[中文翻译]: suggesting that he was not only looking at specifically tariffing Apple

40
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,680
[中文翻译]: but tariffing a specific product line

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,450
[中文翻译]: the iPhone

42
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,210
[中文翻译]: there were a lot of questions swirls around over how could the president do that

43
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:53,040
[中文翻译]: Yesthey could use the emergency authorities and claim under national security interest that you need to tariff an entire industry

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,230
[中文翻译]: but to take one specific company and one s​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌pecific product remain legally ambiguous

45
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,990
[中文翻译]: Although we did hear from the president in the Oval Office just a few minutes ago where he did clarify that quote

46
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,050
[中文翻译]: he didn't want to be unfair to Apple

47
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,340
[中文翻译]: even though Apple and the iPhone were very clearly the specific target of his truth social

48
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:16,260
[中文翻译]: But he said that he would expand the scope of this particular tariff to cover essentially all smartphones that are coming into the United States

49
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,980
[中文翻译]: which would include

50
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,860
[中文翻译]: and he named checked the company's Samsung

51
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,210
[中文翻译]: a Korean phone that makes a lot

52
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,690
[中文翻译]: a Korean phone maker that makes a lot of popular Android based products

53
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,940
[中文翻译]: It does sound like if he does want to follow through on this 25% tariff

54
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,960
[中文翻译]: it wouldn't just cover the iPhone

55
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,770
[中文翻译]: Ryanit would cover all the smartphones that come into this country

56
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,920
[中文翻译]: which there are very few of them made entirely domestically here in the United States

57
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,340
[中文翻译]: Of course

58
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,010
[中文翻译]: the key there

59
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,160
[中文翻译]: will he follow through

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,770
[中文翻译]: Because he's threatened a lot of tariffs necessarily

61
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,010
[中文翻译]: Many of them have actually manifest themselves

62
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,040
[中文翻译]: What else did we hear

63
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,370
[中文翻译]: thoughthe president say about tariffs today

64
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,540
[中文翻译]: It seemed to indicate that these companies will have to eat the tariffs

65
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,060
[中文翻译]: Yeahwell

66
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,560
[中文翻译]: lookthere was the conversation of whether or not the

67
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,230
[中文翻译]: you know

68
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,450
[中文翻译]: president was actually adamant on whether or not these companies should take these costs

69
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:05,230
[中文翻译]: There was a conversation that was reported that he had had with Walmart suggesting that they should take the price increases themselves

70
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:05,730
[中文翻译]: As we know

71
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,990
[中文翻译]: when it comes to the tariffs

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,180
[中文翻译]: any importing company

73
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,880
[中文翻译]: which in many cases are the American companies

74
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,350
[中文翻译]: they're the ones that would have to pay for it

75
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,200
[中文翻译]: Take a listen to this exchange with regards to his clarification over where he thinks the tariffs should be paid for

76
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,370
[中文翻译]: Sometimes the country will lead it

77
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,650
[中文翻译]: Sometimes Walmart will eat it

78
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,330
[中文翻译]: and sometimes it'll be something to pay something extra

79
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,610
[中文翻译]: I don't like it when a department because they'll do a lot of business

80
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,360
[中文翻译]: You know

81
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,730
[中文翻译]: they Ann record profits and everything else have to take out some of their profits

82
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,360
[中文翻译]: So make a little bit less money

83
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,100
[中文翻译]: But I don't want

84
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,180
[中文翻译]: I don't want the consumer

85
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,410
[中文翻译]: I don't want the consumer to pay

86
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,230
[中文翻译]: I don't want the consumer to pay

87
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:41,510
[中文翻译]: But again

88
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,840
[中文翻译]: if we're kind of taking it to the timely story of today

89
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,940
[中文翻译]: which is about these smartphones

90
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,740
[中文翻译]: you have dan ISO

91
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:51,180
[中文翻译]: webu secur saying that an entirely us made iPhone would cost $3500

92
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,080
[中文翻译]: That's a lot more expensive

93
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,880
[中文翻译]: And the $1200 to $1300 it costs today

94
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,910
[中文翻译]: how would the consumer not be able to pay for that

95
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,890
[中文翻译]: It would have to be Apple

96
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,940
[中文翻译]: That's a big question whether whether or not Apple wants to do that

97
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,500
[中文翻译]: Someone's going to have to pay right now

98
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,340
[中文翻译]: I guess we won't know free exactly until it actually is implemented

99
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,100
[中文翻译]: Brian Chung

100
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,480
[中文翻译]: thank you

101
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,010
[中文翻译]: as always

102
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,970
[中文翻译]: Turning now to breaking news

103
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:22,400
[中文翻译]: the Trump administration's ongoing battle with Harvard University as the president continues to attempt to use the power of the presidency to target his perceived critics in a legal blow to the Trump administration

104
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,770
[中文翻译]: a federal judge in Boston is blocking the White House from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students

105
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,770
[中文翻译]: at least for now

106
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,230
[中文翻译]: Yesterdaythe White House terminated Harvard's and Exchange Visitor Program

107
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:46,060
[中文翻译]: aiming to bar the Ivy League University from admitting international students and also forcing current international students to transfer schools or lose their legal status

108
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,920
[中文翻译]: The judge's ruling came just hours after Harvard filed the lawsuit accusing the administration of

109
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:59,290
[中文翻译]: quoteunconstitutional retaliation after the school refused to comply with demands from the White House's task force to combat anti-Semitism

110
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,800
[中文翻译]: The Department of Homeland Security is demanding that Harvard turn over disciplinary

111
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,930
[中文翻译]: criminal and protest records for all students over the last five years

112
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,950
[中文翻译]: Harvard's legal complaint states

113
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,520
[中文翻译]: quotewith the stroke of a pen

114
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:22,020
[中文翻译]: the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard student body international students who contribute significantly to the university and its mission

115
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:35,360
[中文翻译]: Harvard is also suing the Trump administration for halting more than $2 billion in federal research funding last month after the school refused to comply with White House demands to change its hiring and admissions processes

116
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,640
[中文翻译]: NBC News senior digital White House reporter Shannon Petty piece joins me now

117
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,620
[中文翻译]: Also joining me from Harvard is NBC News correspondent Antonia Hilton

118
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,570
[中文翻译]: Shannonlet's start with you

119
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,580
[中文翻译]: Is there any response from the White House right now to the Boston judge's ruling

120
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,290
[中文翻译]: Welldefinitely no signs of the White House or the president backing down on this

121
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:59,940
[中文翻译]: The president was asked a couple hours ago in the Oval Office by a reporter about this action taken
