1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,909
the Huawei MXT ultimate is probably the

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:05,829
most futuristic Flagship on this planet

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,310
right now and probably the largest leap

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,110
in smartphone Evolution since LG had

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,030
that crazy unit with the sideways

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,990
flipping screen may they rest in peace

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,510
this Smartphone has two hinges and three

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,710
screens making it the world's first

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,070
triple folding screen Smartphone when

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,509
fully extended the smartphone is nearly

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,070
the same size as an iPad I mean yeah it

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,589
does cost about $3,000 and for that

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,950
price you could probably duct tapee

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,630
three iPhones together and get almost

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,470
the same effect but there is a lot we

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,709
can learn about this new form factor and

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,029
with Huawei getting 65 million

18
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,790
pre-orders I'm sure there are a lot of

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,910
people with some very valid questions

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,950
about the long-term durability of their

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,110
future

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,189
device which is why I'm here right off

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,869
the bat we get the same warnings as all

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,990
the other folding phones like the Galaxy

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,229
fold and the Motorola Razor things like

26
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,110
don't remove the screen protector and

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,110
don't press too hard on the screen or it

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,470
might get damaged size-wise transforming

29
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,469
from iPad status back into its phone

30
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:08,030
form puts the M XT right about the same

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,310
size as my Galaxy s24 Ultra in a case

32
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,789
pretty mind-blowing to get so much

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,710
screen real estate in such a small

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,350
package the M XT can be a 6.4 in 8 in or

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,270
10.2 in display on a moment's notice and

36
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,149
when either of the two Wings get folded

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,469
in very strong magnets hold everything

38
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,390
into that closed position it's a bit

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,429
discombobulating at first knowing which

40
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,749
flat folds where and I'm a tad nervous

41
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,710
that it might break on accident before I

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,789
can break it on purpose I also have an

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,550
extremely bad feeling about the soft

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,789
folding screen being permanently Exposed

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,789
on the outside and more importantly that

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,670
same soft screen wrapping around the

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,630
exterior edge of the main Bend it's very

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,389
much unprotected all of the time the

49
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,670
exposed radius receiving even a small

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,029
impact from a drop or brush with metal

51
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,029
keys that are in the same pocket would

52
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,190
probably destroy the entire phone and

53
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,830
I'm not sure it can handle the same

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,590
abuse that our regular brick style

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,190
smartphone encounters on The Daily but

56
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,070
as you know we will find out for sure

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,589
what its limits are here in a few

58
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,589
minutes with a few of my specialized

59
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,070
tools and I might regret this but from

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,509
now until Christmas all of my Jerry rig

61
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,710
knives including the transparent Edition

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,589
are just $9.99 until they're gone all

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,630
the knives except for the 24 karat gold

64
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,790
plated version that'll stay expensive

65
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,710
for obvious reasons we're starting the

66
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,190
sale early this year to keep the

67
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,910
holidays a little less hectic for my

68
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,270
team which of course is incredibly easy

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,990

just a computer and a printer holidays

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,110
are hectic and it's nice to have an

76
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,350
early start while avoiding the long

77
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,190
lines at the post office we ship the

78

commitments or contracts just how we

96
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,030
like it stamps.com

97
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,550
Jerri now when we get a screen that conf

98
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,509
Flex plastic is what we expect the only

99
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,229
way to verify though is with the most

100
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,309
scale of hardness using the level two

101
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,949
most pick which is also made from

102
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,190
plastic we start seeing some indentions

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,789
and deformations at a level two with

104
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,910
deeper grooves at a level three the

105
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,550
entire screen of the MXT ultimate both

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,750
inner and outer is fingernail

107
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,030
scratchable levels of plastic which of

108
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,949
course is not a deel breaker just good

109
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,030
information to have plastic is not

110
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,149
necessarily a bad thing but just like

111
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,830
you wouldn't hang drywall wearing a

112
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,429
Rolex or take a Lambo off-roading

113
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,390
actually that does sound kind of fun but

114
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,509
all I'm saying is as a daily driver the

115
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,390
M XT requires clean pockets and a bit of

116
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,390
extra attention the inner 8 megapixel

117
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,310
selfie camera which I won't touch with

118
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,749
my Razor is covered with that same soft

119
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,710
plastic with the screen turned off the

120
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,590
scratch marks from my fingernails and

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,710
plastic tools appear even more visual

122
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,710
ually apparent I don't want the soft

123
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,230
screen to distract from what a

124
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,150
phenomenal technological achievement

125
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,950
this phone has accomplished cuz for

126
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,070
reference if you remember Apple also

127
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,029
made their thinnest product ever this

128
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,550
year with the iPad Pro at 5.1 mm thick

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,070
this MXT ultimate clocks in at four it's

130
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,710
quite mindblowing to

131
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,950
hold the frame appears to be made from

132
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,310
aluminum including the hinge

133
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,029
nibblets the M XT does have stereo

134
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:59,950
loudspeakers the right side of the phone

135
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,230
has the metal volume rocker as well as a

136
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,390
side mounted fingerprint scanner inside

137
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,510
that power

138
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,749
button the three sides of the bottom

139
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,110
contain another loudspeaker a 66 W USBC

140
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,230
Port that's capable of 5w reverse wire

141
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,510
charging and a few microphones we do

142
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,550
have a SIM card tray which does have a

143
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,390
gray rubber ring around the opening but

144
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,670
no official IP or dust resistant rating

145
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,350
it's wild to see however that the

146
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,469
thickness of the physical USB cable that

147
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,670
I'm plugging into the phone is actually

148
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,749
thicker than the phone itself it's like

149
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,390
technology out of a science fiction

150
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,950
movie also there are rumors of a global

151
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,990
launch for this m XT ultimate in 2025

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,629
assuming of course that we're all still

153
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,909
here making our way over to the back the

154
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,749
only part of this phone that's thick is

155
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,070
the camera bump we have a 12 megapixel

156
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,189
Ultra wide camera in the top left corner

157
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,790
the main 50 megap variable aperture lens

158
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,230
is on the bottom and the 12 megap 5

159
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,350
times telephoto is in the upper right

160
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,629
with the laser autofocus below that all

161
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,510
all of which are sitting inside the star

162
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,870
Diamond designed Damascus steel looking

163
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,270
camera bump the red leather which I'm

164
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,189
not sure if it's real or not definitely

165
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,670
has a nice textured feel and the inlaid

166
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,749
Huawei branding and ultimate design

167
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,710
script won't be falling out or coming

168
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,270
out on its own there's a 50 W wireless

169
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,350
charging pad underneath this panel which

170
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,070
we might be lucky enough to see here in

171
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,589
a second the center panel is blank and

172
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,710
the far panel has a designed and crafted

173
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,550
by Huawei token embedded into the

174
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,950
leather the token is made from metal the

175
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,230
internally folding hinge similar to the

176
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,309
spine on Samsung's folding phone is made

177
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,550
from metal while the externally folding

178
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,230
hinge has the soft screen on the spine

179
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,790
which means I'm not going to scratch it

180
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,189
just yet the Damascus looking steel ring

181
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,189
around the camera units however is made

182
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,870
from metal the fully unfolded M XT

183
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,629
ultimate has a 3K resolution 90 HZ ltpo

184
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,029
OLED with 1 billion colors the blue J in

185
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,550
the background looks kind of like that

186
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,469
Twitter bird before it was murdered

187
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,629
under Flame the screen last for about 10

188
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,670
seconds before discoloring and the

189
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,350
surface layer literally melting huaw has

190
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,029
promised that the top layer of the

191
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,230
external screen is eligible for free

192
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,589
Replacements but the screen itself like

193
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,029
the pixel part of it if damaged outside

194
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,869
of warranty would cost about $1,100 to

195
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,990
fix which is surprisingly less than I

196
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,070
thought it would be now remember I do

197
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,990
not Delight in the destruction or

198
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,869
decimation of devices I'm just here to

199
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,070
eloquently educate on the endurance of

200
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,070
electronics where Norm normally if a

201
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,990
regular smartphone got accidentally

202
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,749
covered in sand it wouldn't be the end

203
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,790
of the world there might be some micr

204
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,790
scratches or abrasions on the glass from

205
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,670
the quartz or other hard minerals in the

206
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,430
aggregate but it would ultimately be

207
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,230
fine on a folding phone though

208
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,990
especially one as premium and finely

209
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,430
tuned as this one sand is a death

210
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,390
sentence not from the folding screen

211
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,469
itself now surprisingly that's still

212
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,950
alive and holding its own but the hinges

213
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,309
of the XT ultimate immediately fill up

214
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,869
with dirt and become unusable it's a

215
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,309
incredibly painful

216
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,670
sound I've been doing this dirt test on

217
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,070
folding phones for about 5 years now and

218
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,990
this is the worst grinding we've ever

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,550
encountered the hinge is so full even

220
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,710
after just a few pinches of sand that it

221
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,749
won't close anymore this $3,000 triple

222
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,909
folding smartphone is decidedly

223
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:23,790
decimated by a dash of

224
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,469
dirt going back to the exposed outer

225
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,869
radius of the soft folding screen Huawei

226
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,270
knows that is a weak point on the device

227
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,670
which is why they've included a

228
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,149
protective back panel case that flips up

229
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,389
to protect the exposed Edge definitely

230
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,709
nice protection is always a good thing I

231
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,430
am still curious though what would

232
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,870
happen if that bit of exposed screen did

233
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,230
get impacted during a drop or get

234
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,829
squeezed up against something in your

235
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,269
pocket using a tiny Pebble to press up

236
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,630
against the screen nothing happens I am

237
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,590
using quite a bit of force here but this

238
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,829
rock is small and the phone is still

239
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:59,269
unscathed and fully operational besides

240
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,990
some some cosmetic impressions in the

241
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,350
plastic however using my recently

242
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,310
discounted to 999 Jerry rig knife I can

243
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,670
tap the handle against the exposed Bend

244
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,230
and on the third strike with less Force

245
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,630
than it would have received during a

246
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,750
drop the inner pixels fracture and start

247
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,110
bleeding Black Ink in a Venom like

248
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,389
symbiote the ink permanently blemishes

249
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,710
the 3K resolution screen killing the

250
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,910
pixels underneath it is absolutely

251
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,069
imperative that the mate XT ultimate not

252
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:29,350
only stay away from dust but also never

253
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,310
never receive an impact on the front

254
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,670
unprotected flat display the M XT

255
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,590
ultimate is a marvelous Testament to

256
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,430
Modern engineering and an excellent

257
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,790
showpiece but it's definitely not ready

258
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,590
for the harsh environments of everyday

259
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,829
living one thing that wasn't immediately

260
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,030
intuitive is knowing which side folds

261
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,790
which direction especially since the

262
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,389
phone works in any orientation however

263
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,269
it appears as if Huawei has thought of

264
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,550
this as well and has introduced sensors

265
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,949
inside the phone to vibrate and notify

266
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,230
you if you're bending in the wrong

267
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,990
direction this is is the first

268
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,269
smartphone to ever beg for its life

269
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,550
during the bin test which almost makes

270
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,910
me want to give it a

271
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,150
chance the M XT ultimate can indeed be

272
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,949
catastrophically bent in the wrong

273
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,230
direction again worth repeating that a

274
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,190
device built for upscale eloquence

275
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,230
should be treated delicately with the

276
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,910
device dead it would be doing a

277
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,910
disservice if we didn't disassemble the

278
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,069
different divides the rear panel can

279
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:25,430
pretty much be pulled away without heat

280
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,150
exposing a battery in each of the

281
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,630
individual sections the main camera unit

282
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,230
segment doesn't come away quite as

283
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,430
easily but it

284
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,790
will the two batteries we have exposed

285
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,829
so far are the same size 1,930

286
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,190
milliamp with a bit more persuasion from

287
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,269
my Jerry rig knife the rear panel and

288
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,389
domastic steel camera lens housing does

289
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,389
come away from the

290
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,269
body revealing the absolutely beautiful

291
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,069
internals of the Huawei M XT Ultimate

292
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,269
dual folds triple batteries and if you

293
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,110
look closely you can see the variable

294
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,110
aperture camera open for one last time

295
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,509
the design is exquisitely complex it's

296
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,470
like seeing three phones get taken apart

297
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,110
for the price of three phones getting

298
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,190
taken apart the last battery we find

299
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,110
after unplugging the 50 W wireless

300
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,269
charging pad shows us the smallest of

301
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,470
the three

302
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:22,550
1,740 milliamp hours for a total of

303
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,470
5,600 is the Huawei M XT ultimate the

304
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,590
coolest phone on the planet today

305
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,710
probably yes is the Huawei M XT ultimate

306
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,110
durable most definitely not hit that

307
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,710
subscribe button and thanks a ton for

308
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,399
watching I'll see you around
